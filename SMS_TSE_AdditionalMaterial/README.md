# Combining Model Driven Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, and DevOps to Support Systems and Software Engineering: a Systematic Mapping Study

## Abstract
- **Complexity of Modern Systems**: The paper discusses the challenges posed by the complexity of modern systems like Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the need for efficient system and software engineering processes.
- **Integration of MDE, AI/ML, and DevOps**: It emphasizes the benefits of integrating Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML), and DevOps to support continuous development of complex systems.
- **AIDOaRt Project**: The paper highlights the objectives of the AIDOaRt project, which aims to support AI-augmented automation for modeling, coding, testing, monitoring, and continuous development in CPSs.
- **Systematic Mapping Study**: An extensive review of literature is conducted to explore the current state of research and practical solutions within MDE, AI/ML, and DevOps.

## 1. Introduction
- **Advancing Functionality**: The growing complexity of systems such as Industry 4.0, healthcare, and smart grids is driving the need for advanced functionality enabled by software.
- **Continuous Development**: The paper outlines how DevOps principles can benefit system engineering by supporting a continuous development process that integrates design and runtime perspectives.
- **AI/ML in DevOps**: It also discusses the role of AI/ML in enhancing system design and integration activities, particularly through AIOps, which rethinks the DevOps pipeline with continuous monitoring and remediation.

## 2. Background
