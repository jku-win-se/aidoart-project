The high availability and agility of the cloud demands organizations to migrate or design microservices, promoting the building of applications as a suite of small and cohesive services that are independently developed, deployed and scaled. Current cloud development approaches do not support the incremental integration needed for microservice platforms, and the agility of getting new functionalities out to customers is consequently affected by the lack of support for the integration design and automation of the development and deployment tasks. This paper presents an approach for the incremental integration of microservices that will allow architects to specify and design microservice integration, and provide mechanisms to automatically obtain the implementation code for business logic and interoperation among microservices, along with deployment and architectural reconfiguration scripts specific to the cloud environment in which the microservice will be deployed.","Cloud, Cloud architectures, Incremental, Integration, Microservices architectures",,,,,,,,"<Development and deployment at facebook, {eid: 84880146979}>, <Microservices, IoT, and Azure: Leveraging DevOps and Microservice Architecture to Deliver SaaS Solutions, {eid: 85046792617}>, <None, {eid: 84992401957}>, <None, {eid: 84950338538}>, <Service functional test automation, {eid: 84995934968}>, <None, {eid: 84995906617}>, <Controlling data in the cloud: Outsourcing computation without outsourcing control, {eid: 74049093526}>, <Designing a smart city internet of things platform with microservice architecture, {eid: 84959050879}>, <None, {eid: 85018761953}>, <The cloudMIG approach: Model-based migration of software systems to cloud-optimized applications, {eid: 84886445739}>, <Developing migratable multicloud applications based on MDE and adaptation techniques, {eid: 84884637858}>, <MODAC LOUDS: A model-driven approach for the design and execution of applications on multiple clouds, {eid: 84864997201}>, <An incremental and model driven approach for the dynamic reconfiguration of cloud application architectures, {eid: 84992731072}>, <Towards a model-driven dynamic architecture reconfiguration process for cloud services integration, {eid: 84923259718}>, <The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices, {eid: 85018783151}>, <Framework for platform agnostic enterprise application development supporting multiple clouds, {eid: 84937500863}>, <UML-based cloud application modeling with libraries, profiles, and templates, {eid: 84911965669}>, <A UML Profile for modeling multicloud applications, {eid: 84885733995}>, <Towards CloudML, a model-based approach to provision resources in the clouds, {eid: 84879762752}>, <SeaClouds: A European project on seamless management of multi-cloud applications, {eid: 84920511449}>, <Architecture description language for incremental integration of cloud services architectures, {eid: 85010452220}>, <None, {eid: 84867643299}>, <Evaluating REST architectures-approach, tooling and guidelines, {eid: 84951064164}>, <Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation, {eid: 84903601568}>, <None, {eid: 84950310360}>",,,Springer Heidelberg,,,2017-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85018772815
