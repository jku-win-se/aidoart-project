Different technologies are used for communication between the massive connected devices through all layers of the IoT system, causing many security and performance issues. Regression and integration testing are considered repeatedly, in which the vast costs and efforts associated with the frequent execution of these inflated test suites hinder the adequate testing of such systems. This necessitates the focus on exploring innovative scalable testing approaches for large test suites in IoT-based systems. In this paper, a scalable framework for continuous integration and regression testing in IoT-based systems (IoT-CIRTF) is proposed, based on IoT-related criteria for test case prioritization and selection. The framework utilizes search-based techniques to provide an optimized prioritized set of test cases to select from. The selection is based on a trained prediction model for IoT standard components using supervised deep learning algorithms to continuously ensure the overall reliability of IoT-based systems. The experiments are held on two GSM datasets. The experimental results achieved prioritization accuracy up to 90% and 92% for regression testing and integration testing respectively. This provides an enhanced and efficient framework for continuous testing of IoT-based systems, as per IoT-related criteria for the prioritization and selection purposes.","Deep learning, integration

Regression testing is considered a good practice in software development with continuous integration, which ensures that code changes are not negatively affecting software functionality. As, nowadays, software development is carried out iteratively, with small code increments continuously developed and regression tested, it is of critical importance that continuous regression testing is time efficient. However, in practice, regression testing is often long lasting and faces scalability problems as software grows larger or as software changes are made more frequently. One contributing factor to these issues is test redundancy, which causes the same software functionality being tested multiple times across a test suite. In large-scale software, especially highly configurable software, redundancy in continuous regression testing can significantly grow the size of test suites and negatively affect the cost effectiveness of continuous integration. This paper presents a practical learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration testing by reducing ineffective test redundancy in regression suites. The novelty of the algorithm lies in learning and predicting the fault-detection effectiveness of continuous integration tests using historical test records and combining this information with coverage-based redundancy metrics. The goal is to identify ineffective redundancy, which is maximally reduced in the resulting regression test suite, thus reducing test time and improving the performance of continuous integration. We apply and evaluate the algorithm in two industrial projects of continuous integration. The results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the efficiency of continuous integration practice in terms of decreasing test execution time by 38% on average compared to the industry practice of our case study and by 40% on average compared to the retest-all approach. The results further demonstrate no significant reduction in fault-detection effectiveness of continuous regression testing. This suggests that the proposed algorithm contributes to the state of the practice in the continuous integration development and testing of highly configurable systems.","continuous integration, continuous integration testing, highly configurable software, highly interleaved test predictive algorithm, regression testing, regression trees, test optimization, test redundancy",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85026639599}>, <None, {eid: 84891715780}>, <None, {eid: 84935135489}>, <None, {eid: 84986877429}>, <None, {eid: 85049691252}>, <An AETG system: an approach to testing based on combinatorial design, {eid: 0000673732}>, <None, {eid: 0037587652}>, <None, {eid: 33847694980}>, <Test overlay in an emerging software product line - an industrial case study, {eid: 84872969667}>, <Learning from examples, generation and evaluation of decision trees for software resource analysis, {eid: 0024123707}>, <None, {eid: 0003512056}>, <Practical minimization of pairwise-covering test configurations using constraint programming, {eid: 84952845547}>, <Top 10 algorithms in data mining, {eid: 37549018049}>, <Predicting business failure using classification and regression tree: an empirical comparison with popular classical statistical methods and top classification mining methods, {eid: 77951206489}>, <None, {eid: 85060261902}>, <None, {eid: 67650148487}>, <None, {eid: 0036041041}>, <None, {eid: 85013123088}>, <None, {eid: 0003500248}>, <None, {eid: 85009962818}>, <None, {eid: 12844268515}>, <None, {eid: 1542347191}>, <None, {eid: 85060264405}>, <None, {eid: 33847304574}>, <None, {eid: 84944678252}>, <None, {eid: 84951764887}>, <Program slicing-based regression testing techniques, {eid: 0030173997}>, <A safe, efficient regression test selection technique, {eid: 0031125046}>, <Cost-effective regression testing through adaptive test prioritization strategies, {eid: 84960881560}>, <None, {eid: 84951766869}>, <None, {eid: 0036441907}>, <None, {eid: 84963549010}>, <None, {eid: 84964268054}>, <None, {eid: 85030784137}>, <None, {eid: 84997112179}>, <None, {eid: 85060264122}>, <None, {eid: 84856946297}>, <None, {eid: 85060263683}>, <None, {eid: 0032305987}>, <A tester-assisted methodology for test redundancy detection, {eid: 78149252006}>, <Redundancy based test-suite reduction, {eid: 37149024582}>, <A methodology for controlling the size of a test suite, {eid: 0027625420}>, <None, {eid: 33646942742}>, <Improving fault detection capability by selectively retaining test cases during test suite reduction, {eid: 33846855360}>, <An empirical study of test case filtering techniques based on exercising information flows, {eid: 34250772325}>, <None, {eid: 77949900972}>, <None, {eid: 84863156883}>, <None, {eid: 84903123998}>, <Empirical studies of test-suite reduction, {eid: 0036957531}>, <None, {eid: 15844394509}>",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,2019-02-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85056634616

Often a representation that reflects the internal structure of the managed system is used to reason about its characteristics and make the appropriate adaptation decisions. However, runtime conditions can radically change the internal structure in ways that were not accounted for during their design. As a result, unanticipated changes at runtime that violate the assumptions made about the internal structure of the system could degrade the accuracy of the adaptation decisions. We present an approach for engineering self-adaptive software systems that brings about two innovations: 1) a feature-oriented approach for representing engineers' knowledge of adaptation choices that are deemed practical, and 2) an online learning-based approach for assessing and reasoning about adaptation decisions that does not require an explicit representation of the internal structure of the managed software system. Engineers' knowledge, represented in feature-models, adds structure to learning, which in turn makes online learning feasible. We present an empirical evaluation of the framework using a real-world self-adaptive software system. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to accurately learn the changing dynamics of the system while achieving efficient analysis and adaptation. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Autonomic computing,

CPSs are systems that integrate digital cyber computations with physical processes. The development of software for CPSs demands a constant maintenance to support new requirements, bug fixes, and deal with hardware obsolescence. The key in this process is code testing and more if the code is fragmented during the development of CPSs. It is important to remark that this process is challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we report on the experience of instantiating of the microservice-based architecture for DevOps of CPSs to test elevator dispatching algorithms across different test levels (i.e., SiL, HiL and Operation). Such an architecture allows for a continuous deployment, monitoring and validation of CPSs. By integrating the approach with a real industrial case study, we demonstrate that our approach reduces significantly the time needed in the testing process and consequently, reduces the economic cost of the entire process.","Cyber-Physical Systems, Elevators, Testing",,,,,,,,"<Deis: Dependability engineering innovation for industrial cps, {eid: 85052091111}>, <Automatic generation of test system

Rapid evolution and continuous deployment represent specific benefits of microservice-based systems, but they may have a significant impact on non-functional properties like performance. Despite the obvious relevance of this property, there is still a lack of systematic approaches that explicitly take into account performance issues in the lifecycle of microservice-based systems. In such a context of evolution and re-deployment, Model-Driven Engineering techniques can provide major support to various software engineering activities, and in particular they can allow managing the relationships between a running system and its architectural model. In this paper, we propose a model-driven integrated approach that exploits traceability relationships between the monitored data of a microservice-based running system and its architectural model to derive recommended refactoring actions that lead to performance improvement. The approach has been applied and validated on two microservice-based systems, in the domain of e-commerce and ticket reservation, respectively, whose architectural models have been designed in UML profiled with MARTE.","Continuous deployment, Microservices, Model-driven engineering, Performance engineering, Software evolution, Software refactoring",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85117092929}>, <Performance-driven software model refactoring, {eid: 85029760730, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2017.09.006}>, <Exploiting architecture/runtime model-driven traceability for performance improvement, {eid: 85065793737, doi: 10.1109/ICSA.2019.00017}>, <Performance-based software model refactoring in fuzzy contexts, {eid: 84944250248, doi: 10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_10}>, <Models@run.time: a guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, {eid: 85059780955, doi: 10.1007/s10270-018-00712-x}>, <Models@run.time, {eid: 85008066028, doi: 10.1109/MC.2009.326}>, <Model-driven engineering for design-runtime interaction in complex systems: Scientific challenges and roadmap -

It has been demonstrated that historical information-based reward function can improve the effectiveness of the test case prioritization (TCP). However, the inherent character of frequent iterations in CI can produce a considerable accumulation of historical information, which may decrease TCP efficiency and result in slow feedback. In this paper, the partial historical information is considered in the reward computation, where sliding window techniques are adopted to capture the possible efficient information. Firstly, the fixed-size sliding window is introduced to set a fixed length of recent historical information for each CI test. Then dynamic sliding window techniques are proposed, where the window size is continuously adaptive to each CI testing. Two methods are proposed, the test suite-based dynamic sliding window and the individual test case-based dynamic sliding window. The empirical studies are conducted on fourteen industrial-level programs, and the results reveal that under limited time, the sliding window-based reward function can effectively improve the TCP effect, where the NAPFD (Normalized Average Percentage of Faults Detected) and Recall of the dynamic sliding windows are better than that of the fixed-size sliding window. In particular, the individual test case-based dynamic sliding window approach can rank 74.18% failed test cases in the top 50% of the sorting sequence, with 1.35% improvement of NAPFD and 6.66 positions increased in TTF (Test to Fail).","Continuous integration, reinforcement learning, reward computation, sliding window, test case prioritization",,,,,,,,"<Continuous integration, delivery and deployment: A systematic review on approaches, tools, challenges and practices, {eid: 85019140530}>, <Continuous integration and its tools, {eid: 84899646622}>, <Test case prioritization in continuous integration environments: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85078708254}>, <Effect of time window on the performance of continuous regression testing, {eid: 85013123088}>, <Comparing white-box and black-box test prioritization, {eid: 84971425590}>, <Test re-prioritization in continuous testing environments, {eid: 85058303599}>, <Reinforcement learning: An introduction, {eid: 85067344495}>, <Reinforcement learning for automatic test case prioritization and selection in continuous integration, {eid: 85026639599}>, <Learning-to-rank vs ranking-to-learn: Strategies for regression testing in continuous integration, {eid: 85094318353}>, <Reward, motivation, and reinforcement learning, {eid: 0037057808}>, <A systematic study of reward for reinforcement learning based continuous integration testing, {eid: 85089907018}>, <Reward of reinforcement learning of test optimization for continuous integration, {eid: 85071576780}>, <History-based test case prioritization with software version awareness, {eid: 84885230977}>, <Test case prioritization approaches in regression testing: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85028775957}>, <Failure history data-based test case prioritization for effective regression test, {eid: 85020852947}>, <A time window based reinforcement learning reward for test case prioritization in continuous integration, {eid: 85092308710}>, <A study of effective regression testing in practice, {eid: 0031335528}>, <Prioritizing test cases for regression testing, {eid: 0035481183}>, <A survey on regression test-case prioritization, {eid: 85058421655}>, <Relationbased test case prioritization for regression testing, {eid: 85079013222}>, <Version specific test case prioritization approach based on artificial neural network, {eid: 85067622737}>, <Incorporating fault-proneness estimations into coverage-based test case prioritization methods, {eid: 85079054649}>, <Requirements based test prioritization using risk factors, {eid: 84946595421}>, <History-based test case prioritization for failure information, {eid: 85018510656}>, <Search algorithms for regression test case prioritization, {eid: 34047189734}>, <A fine-grained parallel multiobjective test case prioritization on GPU, {eid: 84884966832}>, <None, {eid: 84951288122}>, <Epistasis based ACO for regression test case prioritization, {eid: 85039920863}>, <An empirical study of regression testing techniques incorporating context and lifetime factors and improved costbene fit models, {eid: 34547306676}>, <Selecting a cost-effective test case prioritization technique, {eid: 3142772245}>, <The impact of continuous integration on other software development practices: A large-scale empirical study, {eid: 85041445161}>, <How does regression test prioritization perform in real-world software evolution?, {eid: 84971393429}>, <Prioritizing JUnit test cases in absence of coverage information, {eid: 70849096646}>, <Techniques for improving regression testing in continuous integration development environments, {eid: 84986877429}>, <Test case prioritization for continuous regression testing: An industrial case study, {eid: 84891715780}>, <Enhanced weighted method for test case prioritization in regression testing using unique priority value, {eid: 85018268821}>, <Experience report: Automated system level regression test prioritization using multiple factors, {eid: 85013287871}>, <Test prioritization in continuous integration environments, {eid: 85053760573}>, <None, {eid: 85102302639}>, <None, {eid: 85102288696}>, <None, {eid: 85102275463}>, <None, {eid: 85010746053}>, <Reinforcement learning and the reward engineering principle, {eid: 85048232151}>, <Combinatorial interaction regression testing: A study of test case generation and prioritization, {eid: 47349111813}>, <Prioritizing test cases for regression testing, {eid: 0035481183}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85102280980

Knowledge about software architecture is key for both, developers while evolving the system and operators while adapting the system. Existing architectural models used in development differ from those used in operation in terms of purpose, abstraction and content. Consequences are limited reuse of development models during operation, lost architectural knowledge and limited phase-spanning consideration of software architecture. In this paper, we propose modeling concepts of the iObserve approach to align architectural models used in development and operation. We present a correspondence model to bridge the divergent levels of abstraction between implementation artifacts and component-based architectural models. A transformation pipeline uses the information stored in the correspondence model to update architectural models based on changes during operation. Moreover, we discuss the modeling of complex workload based on observations during operation. In a case study-based evaluation, we examine the accuracy of our models to reflect observations during operation and the scalability of the transformation pipeline. Evaluation results show the accuracy of iObserve. Furthermore, evaluation results indicate iObserve adequately scales for some cases but shows scalability limits for others.","Palladio Component Model, Performance model, Runtime model, Software

This process is known as architecture erosion. In this article, we propose an approach for recovering the implemented architecture, and detecting violations when comparing it with the intended architecture. Given a code repository, the continuous integration pipeline calls the solution to detect the incidences of architecture violations as well as some quality and social metrics. This data is presented in metric-centered views that help development teams to manage architecture erosion. Our approach is based on model-driven engineering techniques since models serve to represent the code, and a model-based pattern language helps us to automate the search for violation occurrences and execute corresponding actions (e.g., creation/assignment of issues). We confirm the approach benefits in a real project implemented by a software developing company, in a sample project available on the internet, and in a software development course, including 20 projects, where every single project decreases its architecture violations density through time.","architecture discovering, architecture recovering, conformance checking, continuous integration",,,,,,,,"<Decision making in software architecture, {eid: 84956623197}>, <Technical debt and system architecture: the impact of coupling on defect-related activity, {eid: 85027922641}>, <Towards a reference process for software architecture reconstruction, {eid: 85097339934}>, <Controlling software architecture erosion: a survey, {eid: 80755136651}>, <Software architecture erosion: impacts, causes, and management, {eid: 85107011113}>, <Software architecture degradation in open source software: a systematic literature review, {eid: 85101866665}>, <Recovering architectural assumptions, {eid: 33645145073}>, <Documenting after the fact: recovering architectural design decisions, {eid: 40049088606}>, <None, {eid: 77955136099}>, <None, {eid: 84951865531}>, <None, {eid: 85049697376}>, <None, {eid: 84855434526}>, <Detecting, tracing, and monitoring architectural tactics in code, {eid: 84963878679}>, <None, {eid: 84963491024}>, <None, {eid: 85119561514}>, <None, {eid: 85044185772}>, <None, {eid: 85051569623}>, <None, {eid: 85107002894}>, <None, {eid: 85075921993}>, <A collaborative framework to minimise knowledge loss in new product development, {eid: 84873437909}>, <None, {eid: 78649777834}>, <None, {eid: 85102555475}>, <None, {eid: 84964607566}>, <None, {eid: 84879856670}>",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,2021-08-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85106982705

Software development therefore is critical to the success of the manufacturer to develop state of the art technology. Standards like ISO 26262 recommend requirement-based verification and test cases that are derived from requirements analysis. Agile development uses continuous integration tests which rely on test automation and evaluation. All these drove the development of a new model-based software verification environment. Various aspects had to be taken into account: the test case specification needs to be easily comprehensible and flexible in order to allow testing of different functional variants. The test environment should support different use cases like open-loop or closed-loop testing and has to provide corresponding evaluation methods for continuously changing as well as for discrete signals. In a joint project of RWTH Aachen University and Ford, a new tool, Arttest, has been developed for testing model-based software. The tool uses a domain specific language to specify the tests. It offers different test evaluation methods for automated open- and closed-loop testing and reactive testing. It automatically executes the tests, evaluates the outputs and generates summary reports indicating passed tests and errors found. The paper presents the tool and its various unique propositions such as domain specific test language, the evaluation properties and other features like open-loop and closed-loop capabilities.",,,,,,,,,"<Economical impact of model-based development of embedded software systems in cars, {eid: 79960107950, doi: 10.1365/s35595-011-0026-3}>, <Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Technology, {eid: 85018402638}>, <None, {eid: 0004217479}>, <None, {eid: 85018446942}>, <IEEE standard for floating-point arithmetic, {eid: 69149088136}>, <WCOMP: Waveform Comparison Tool for Mixed-signal Validation Regression in Memory Design, {eid: 46649090540}>",,,SAE International,,,2017-04-04,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85018395241

Electrification, autonomous driving, and connected cars are some of the driving needs in this changing world. Increasingly, vehicles are becoming software-intensive complex systems and most of the innovation within the automotive industry is based on electronics and software. Modern vehicles can have over 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are small computers, together executing gigabytes of software. ECUs are connected to each other through several networks within the car, and the car is increasingly connected with the outside world. These novelties ask for a change on how the software is engineered and produced and for a disruptive renovation of the electrical and software architecture of the car. In this paper we describe the current investigation of Volvo Cars to create an architecture framework able to cope with the complexity and needs of present and future vehicles. Specifically, we present scenarios that describe demands for the architectural framework and introduce three new viewpoints that need to be taken into account for future architectural decisions: Continuous Integration and Deployment, Ecosystem and Transparency, and car as a constituent of a System of Systems. Our results are based on a series of focus groups with experts in automotive engineering and architecture from different companies and universities.","Architecture framework, Automotive domain, Automotive ecosystem, Continuous integration and deployment, Software architecture, Systems of Systems",,,,,,,,"<How KETs can contribute to the re-industrialisation of Europe, {eid: 85020620820}>, <A proposal for an automotive architecture framework for Volvo Cars, {eid: 84978258746, doi: 10.1109/WASA.2016.9}>, <None, {eid: 85020619457}>, <Toward a holistic and standardized automotive architecture description, {eid: 73449140146}>, <None, {eid: 84957056085}>, <Viewpoints: a framework for integrating multiple perspectives in system development, {eid: 0003112251}>, <The 4+1 view model of architecture, {eid: 0029408391}>, <Software Systems Architecture: Working With Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives, {eid: 33751002702}>, <Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, {eid: 0006029493}>, <The Process of Software Architecting, {eid: 77958190800}>, <Every architecture description needs a framework: expressing architecture frameworks using ISO/IEC 42010, {eid: 74349118841}>, <None, {eid: 85020690691}>, <None, {eid: 85020643792}>, <None, {eid: 85020643819}>, <None, {eid: 85020646390}>, <None, {eid: 84870680275}>, <SADT: Structured Analysis and Design Technique, {eid: 0004133986}>, <Unified Modeling Language User Guide, The (2Nd Edition) (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series), {eid: 0003547470}>, <The east-adl architecture description language for automotive embedded software, {eid: 78449253285}>, <A Practical Guide to SysML: Systems Modeling Language, {eid: 85013989545}>, <Automotive Architecture Framework: Towards a Holistic and Standardised System Architecture Description, {eid: 77950427624}>, <Towards an architectural design framework for automotive systems development, {eid: 84883885003, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-34404-6_16}>, <What industry needs from architectural languages: a survey, {eid: 84878389746}>, <A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages, {eid: 0033892696}>, <Automotive software development: a model based approach, {eid: 85072506138}>, <Architecting in the automotive domain: descriptive vs. prescriptive architecture, {eid: 84943248995, doi: 10.1109/WICSA.2015.18}>, <Descriptive vs. prescriptive models in industry, {eid: 85008425440}>, <The road ahead for architectural languages, {eid: 84922874903, doi: 10.1109/MS.2014.28}>, <What do software architects really do?, {eid: 53949091609, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2008.08.025}>, <Organic evolution of development organizations-an experience report, {eid: 85072357057}>, <How much up-front?

Embracing automation at every layer of performance management enables us to reduce costs while improving outcomes. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of autonomic management requirements of Cloud-native applications. We propose that the automation is achieved via high-level policies. In turn autonomy features are accomplished via the rule engine support. First, the paper presents the engineering perspective of building a framework for Autonomic Management of Cloud-Native Applications, namely AMoCNA, in accordance with Model Driven Architecture (MDA) concepts. AMoCNA has many desirable features whose main goal is to reduce the complexity of managing Cloud-native applications. The presented models are, in fact, meta-models, being technology agnostic. Secondly, the paper demonstrates one possibility of implementing the aforementioned design procedures. The presented AMoCNA implementation is also evaluated to identify the potential overhead introduced by the framework.","Autonomic Computing (AC), Cloud-native, Observability, Policy-driven management, Resource management",,,,,,,,"<Rule engine based lightweight framework for adaptive and autonomic computing, {eid: 47749149969}>, <None, {eid: 77951168228}>, <Orchestrating complex application architectures in heterogeneous clouds, {eid: 85091492884}>, <Resource-Definition Policies for Autonomic Computing, {eid: 67650673423}>, <None, {eid: 85065797199}>, <None, {eid: 85091487278}>, <An sla- based broker for cloud infrastructures, {eid: 84874663533, doi: 10.1007/s10723-012-9241-4}>, <Building lean continuous integration and delivery pipelines by applying devops principles: A case study at varidesk, {eid: 85058271814}>, <Dependable mesh networking patterns, {eid: 85076670133}>, <None, {eid: 85091495200}>, <None, {eid: 85091487217}>, <None, {eid: 85091479034}>, <None, {eid: 85091520036}>, <None, {eid: 0141684320}>, <None, {eid: 67651248827}>, <The dawning of the autonomic computing era, {eid: 0037236308, doi: 10.1147/sj.421.0005}>, <Data-Driven Monitoring for Cloud Compute Systems, {eid: 85009097790}>, <Iaasmon: Monitoring architecture for public cloud computing data centers, {eid: 84960102697, doi: 10.1007/s10723-015-9357-4}>, <None, {eid: 85091509890}>, <A survey of autonomic computing – degrees, models, and applications, {eid: 42449088961, doi: 10.1145/1380584.1380585}>, <None, {eid: 85091488312}>, <None, {eid: 85091531968}>, <None, {eid: 85091486634}>, <None, {eid: 85091539340}>, <None, {eid: 85091502096}>, <On the general theory of control systems, {eid: 84936764522, doi: 10.1109/TAC.1959.1104873}>, <The vision of autonomic computing, {eid: 0037253062, doi: 10.1109/MC.2003.1160055}>, <None, {eid: 85040769709}>, <Adaptive SOA solution stack, {eid: 84861921234, doi: 10.1109/TSC.2011.8}>, <None, {eid: 85091523873}>, <Supporting programmable autoscaling rules for containers and virtual machines on clouds, {eid: 85072128121, doi: 10.1007/s10723-019-09488-w}>, <A brief history of cloud application architectures, {eid: 85051750704, doi: 10.3390/app8081368}>, <Clouns - A Cloud-native Application Reference Model for Enterprise Architects, {eid: 85091479401}>, <Intellectual Property and Open Source: A Practical Guide to Protecting Code, 1 edn.

Existing RTS approaches based on UML models use behavioral diagrams or a combination of structural and behavioral diagrams. However, in practice, behavioral diagrams are incomplete or not used. In previous work, we proposed a fuzzy logic based RTS approach called FLiRTS that uses UML sequence and activity diagrams. In this work, we introduce FLiRTS 2, which drops the need for behavioral diagrams and relies on system models that only use UML class diagrams, which are the most widely used UML diagrams in practice. FLiRTS 2 addresses the unavailability of behavioral diagrams by classifying test cases using fuzzy logic after analyzing the information commonly provided in class diagrams. We evaluated FLiRTS 2 on UML class diagrams extracted from 3331 revisions of 13 open-source software systems, and compared the results with those of code-based dynamic (Ekstazi) and static (STARTS) RTS approaches. The average test suite reduction using FLiRTS 2 was 82.06%. The average safety violations of FLiRTS 2 with respect to Ekstazi and STARTS were 18.88% and 16.53%, respectively. FLiRTS 2 selected on average about 82% of the test cases that were selected by Ekstazi and STARTS. The average precision violations of FLiRTS 2 with respect to Ekstazi and STARTS were 13.27% and 9.01%, respectively. The average mutation score of the full test suites was 18.90%; the standard deviation of the reduced test suites from the average deviation of the mutation score for each subject was 1.78% for FLiRTS 2, 1.11% for Ekstazi, and 1.43% for STARTS. Our experiment demonstrated that the performance of FLiRTS 2 is close to the state-of-art tools for code-based RTS but requires less information and performs the selection in less time.","Class diagram, Fuzzy logic, Regression test selection, UML",,,,,,,,"<An extension of class diagram to model the structure of context-aware systems, {eid: 85110943912}>, <A fuzzy logic based approach for model-based regression test selection, {eid: 85040586834}>, <Model-based regression test selection for validating runtime adaptation of software systems, {eid: 84983288652}>, <Supporting inheritance hierarchy changes in model-based regression test selection, {eid: 85037103803, doi: 10.1007/s10270-017-0636-3}>, <Is mutation an appropriate tool for testing experiments?, {eid: 84994006258}>, <ReTEST: A cost effective test case selection technique for modern software development, {eid: 85059652407}>, <Extended UML for the development of context-aware applications, {eid: 84880478665}>, <None, {eid: 84924717453, doi: 10.1017/CBO9780511801129}>, <None, {eid: 85055572256}>, <Heavyweight extension to the UML class diagram metamodel for modeling context aware systems in ubiquitous computing, {eid: 85031778537}>, <Automating regression test selection based on UML designs, {eid: 56649118931, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2008.09.010}>, <Model differences in the eclipse modeling framework, {eid: 70849087833}>, <Fine-grained software evolution using UML activity and class models, {eid: 84886838477}>, <Fine-grained semi-automated runtime evolution, {eid: 84904811259}>, <Specification-based regression test selection with risk analysis, {eid: 24944502842}>, <jFuzzyLogic: a java library to design fuzzy logic controllers according to the standard for fuzzy control programming, {eid: 84880075316, doi: 10.1080/18756891.2013.818190}>, <A study on techniques for the automatic generation of membership functions for pattern recognition, {eid: 73649114627}>, <PIT: A practical mutation testing tool for java, {eid: 84984920723}>, <Ten years of genetic fuzzy systems: current framework and new trends, {eid: 0346781553, doi: 10.1016/S0165-0114(03)00111-8}>, <None, {eid: 79959245159, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-00234-2}>, <None, {eid: 85110938570}>, <How UML is used, {eid: 33745921784, doi: 10.1145/1125944.1125949}>, <A realistic empirical evaluation of the costs and benefits of UML in software maintenance, {eid: 45449102151, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2008.15}>, <A systematic review on regression test selection techniques, {eid: 70350570383, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2009.07.001}>, <A model-based regression testing approach for evolving software systems with flexible tool support, {eid: 77953222030}>, <On the use of uml documentation in software maintenance: results from a survey in industry, {eid: 84961575335}>, <None, {eid: 85110943133}>, <Analyze your classes, {eid: 85110992662}>, <Dynamic update of java applications-balancing change flexibility vs programming transparency, {eid: 63849136008, doi: 10.1002/smr.406}>, <Does UML make the grade?

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Design-Time evaluation is essential to build the initial software architecture to be deployed. However, experts' assumptions made at design-Time are unlikely to remain true indefinitely in systems that are characterized by scale, hyperconnectivity, dynamism, and uncertainty in operations (e.g. IoT). Therefore, experts' design-Time decisions can be challenged at run-Time. A continuous architecture evaluation that systematically assesses and intertwines design-Time and run-Time decisions is thus necessary. This paper proposes the first proactive approach to continuous architecture evaluation of the system leveraging the support of simulation. The approach evaluates software architectures by not only tracking their performance over time, but also forecasting their likely future performance through machine learning of simulated instances of the architecture. This enables architects to make cost-effective informed decisions on potential changes to the architecture. We perform an IoT case study to show how machine learning on simulated instances of architecture can fundamentally guide the continuous evaluation process and influence the outcome of architecture decisions. A series of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach. We also provide the architect with recommendations on how to best benefit from the approach through choice of learners and input parameters, grounded on experimentation and evidence.","Continuous

A major challenge is the high heterogeneity of their infrastructure, which broadens the surface for security attacks and increases the complexity of maintaining and evolving such complex systems. In this paper, we present our approach for Generation and Deployment of Smart IoT Systems (GeneSIS) to tame this complexity. GeneSIS leverages model-driven engineering to support the DevSecOps of Smart IoT Systems (SIS). More precisely, GeneSIS includes: (i) a domain specific modelling language to specify the deployment of SIS over IoT, Edge and Cloud infrastructure with the necessary concepts for security and privacy; and (ii) a models@run. time engine to enact the orchestration, deployment, and adaptation of these SIS. The results from our smart building case study have shown that GeneSIS can support security by design from the development (via deployment) to the operation of IoT systems and back again in a DevSecOps loop. In other words, GeneSIS enables IoT systems to keep up security and adapt to evolving conditions and threats while maintaining their trustworthiness.","DecSecOps, Deployment, DSL, IoT, MDE, Models@run. time",,,,,,,,"<Understanding the software communications architecture, {eid: 70350324202}>, <Rearchitecting the UML infrastructure, {eid: 0141796082}>, <None, {eid: 85008066028}>, <A systematic review of cloud modeling languages, {eid: 85042469266}>, <D-lite: Distributed logic for internet of things services, {eid: 84857617841}>, <Software deployment, past, present and future, {eid: 34748846536}>, <Opentosca for iot: Automating the deployment of iot applications based on the mosquitto message broker, {eid: 85000926700}>, <None, {eid: 85067431815}>, <Cloudmf: Model-driven management of multi-cloud applications, {eid: 85041437398}>, <Development and operation of trustworthy smart IoT systems: The ENACT framework, {eid: 85079102926}>, <Genesis: Continuous orchestration and deployment of smart iot systems, {eid: 85072692587}>, <Enact: Development, operation, and quality assurance of trustworthy smart iot systems, {eid: 85061085691}>, <Developing iot applications in the fog: A distributed dataflow approach, {eid: 84962284412}>, <None, {eid: 24344495942}>, <Thingml: A language and code generation framework for heterogeneous targets, {eid: 85008457888}>, <A generic service oriented software platform to design ambient intelligent systems, {eid: 84962524282}>, <Calvin constrained-a framework for iot applications in heterogeneous environments, {eid: 85027276378}>, <Devsecops: A multivocal literature review, {eid: 85029742916}>, <Advances in deployment and orchestration approaches for IoT-a systematic review, {eid: 85072691780}>, <Towards a smart applications development framework, {eid: 85089682565}>, <A conceptual foundation for component-based software deployment, {eid: 0035878887}>",,,Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets,,,2020-07-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85089665982

The need for rigorous and continuous development of highly networked software-intensive Industry 4.0 systems entails great challenges. Hence, Industry 4.0 requires new ways to develop, operate, and evolve these systems accordingly. Objective: We introduce the view of Continuous Systems and Software Engineering for Industry 4.0 (CSSE I4.0). Method: Based on our research and industrial projects, we propose this novel view and its core elements, including continuous twinning, which is also introduced first in this paper. We also discuss the existing industrial engagement and research that could leverage this view for practical application. Results: There are still several open issues, so we highlight the most urgent perspectives for future work. Conclusions: A disruptive view on how to engineer Industry 4.0 systems must be established to pave the way for the realization of the fourth industrial revolution.","Continuous Software Engineering, Continuous Systems and Software Engineering, Industry 4.0",,,,,,,,"<Continuous software engineering: A roadmap and agenda, {eid: 84937109068, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2015.06.063}>, <Industrie 4.0 virtual automation bus, {eid: 85049697893, doi: 10.1145/3183440.3195065}>, <Digital twin in manufacturing: A categorical literature review and classification, {eid: 85052915281, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2018.08.474}>, <Reference architecture and product line architecture: A subtle but critical difference, {eid: 80053176890, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-23798-0˙22}>, <Dimensions of digital twin applications - a literature review, {eid: 85084019743}>, <Digital twin in industry: State-of-the-art, {eid: 85054374767, doi: 10.1109/TII.2018.2873186}>, <Digital twin reference model development to prevent operators’ risk in process plants, {eid: 85081226177, doi: 10.3390/su12031088}>, <Digital twin-based cyber physical production system architectural framework for personalized production, {eid: 85076628276, doi: 10.1007/s00170-019-04653-7}>, <Enabling continuous software engineering for embedded systems architectures with virtual prototypes, {eid: 85057277198, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-00761-4˙8}>, <Simulation in Industry 4.0: A state-of-the-art review, {eid: 85091194972, doi: 10.1016/j.cie.2020.106868}>, <Intelligent manufacturing in the context of industry 4.0: A review, {eid: 85040743821, doi: 10.1016/J.ENG.2017.05.015}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2021-07-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85101936938

However, the manual classification of metamodel in repositories produces results that are influenced by the subjectivity of human perception besides being tedious and prone to errors. Therefore, automated techniques for classifying metamodels stored in repositories are highly desirable and stringent. In this work, we propose MEMOCNN as a novel approach to classification of metamodels. In particular, we consider metamodels as data points and classify them using supervised learning techniques. A convolutional neural network has been built to learn from labeled data, and use the trained weights to group unlabeled metamodels. A comprehensive experimental evaluation proves that the proposal effectively categorizes input data and outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline.",,,,,,,,,"<Survey on multiclass classification methods, {eid: 84880565628}>, <Convolutional neural networks for classification of alignments of non-coding RNA sequences, {eid: 85050806688, doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty228}>, <A labeled ecore metamodel dataset for domain clustering, {eid: 85076082027, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.2585456}>, <AMMoRe 2018: First international workshop on analytics and mining of model repositories, {eid: 85063109105}>, <Using n-grams for the automated clustering of structural models, {eid: 85010689255}>, <Hierarchical clustering of metamodels for comparative analysis and visualization, {eid: 84977499772}>, <Automatic model repair using reinforcement learning, {eid: 85063099879}>, <Personalized and automatic model repairing using reinforcement learning, {eid: 85075917035}>, <Automated clustering of metamodel repositories, {eid: 84976614553}>, <Analysis methods in neural language processing: A survey, {eid: 85150632897, doi: 10.1162/tacl_a_00254}>, <A classification of stereotypes for object-oriented modeling languages, {eid: 78049335165}>, <Selecting Representative Data Sets, {eid: 84884901728}>, <A suite of metamodels as a basis for a classification of visual languages, {eid: 16244390554, doi: 10.1109/VLHCC.2004.5}>, <None, {eid: 85096089841}>, <An LSTM-based neural network architecture for model transformations, {eid: 85076107429, doi: 10.1109/MODELS.2019.00013}>, <Automated classification of web documents into a hierarchy of categories, {eid: 33745765401}>, <The relationship between precision-recall and ROC curves, {eid: 34250727580, doi: 10.1145/1143844.1143874}>, <Collaborative repositories in model-driven engineering software technology, {eid: 84928652460}>, <None, {eid: 79951904922}>, <A few useful things to know about machine learning, {eid: 84867539048, doi: 10.1145/2347736.2347755}>, <A comparison study between MLP and convolutional neural network models for character recognition, {eid: 85022055406, doi: 10.1117/12.2262589}>, <Automated fruit recognition using EfficientNet and MixNet, {eid: 85081045019, doi: 10.1016/j.compag.2020.105326}>, <An introduction to ROC analysis, {eid: 33646023117, doi: 10.1016/j.patrec.2005.10.010}>, <Olive fruits recognition using neural networks.

This becomes more problematic when Continuous Integration (CI) practices are adopted. CI leads the software to be integrated and tested multiple times a day, subject to time constraints (budgets). To address CI challenges, a learning-based test case prioritization approach named COLEMAN has been successfully applied. COLEMAN deals with test case volatility, in which some test cases can be included/removed over the CI cycles. Nevertheless, such an approach does not consider HCS particularities such as, by analogy, the volatility of variants. Given such a context, this work introduces two strategies for applying COLEMAN in the CI of HCS: the Variant Test Set Strategy (VTS) that relies on the test set specific for each variant; and the Whole Test Set Strategy (WST) that prioritizes the test set composed by the union of the test cases of all variants. Both strategies are applied to two real-world HCSs, considering three test budgets. Independently of the time budget, the proposed strategies using COLEMAN have the best performance in comparison with solutions generated randomly and by another learning approach from the literature. Moreover, COLEMAN produces, in more than 92% of the cases, reasonable solutions that are near to the optimal solutions obtained by a deterministic approach. Both strategies spend less than one second to execute. WTS provides better results in the less restrictive budgets, and VTS the opposite. WTS seems to better mitigate the problem of beginning without knowledge, and is more suitable when a new variant to be tested is added.","Continuous integration, Highly-configurable software, Software product line, Test case prioritization",,,,,,,,"<Delta-oriented product prioritization for similarity-based product-line testing, {eid: 85027114086}>, <A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, {eid: 79959871222}>, <Learning-to-rank vs ranking-to-learn: Strategies for regression testing in continuous integration, {eid: 85094318353}>, <None, {eid: 84961347393}>, <History-Based Test Case Prioritization for Failure Information, {eid: 85018510656}>, <A review of ten years of the symposium on search-based software engineering, {eid: 85072863599}>, <None, {eid: 0003414693}>, <An empirical study of the effect of time constraints on the cost-benefits of regression testing, {eid: 77950490739}>, <Continuous integration: Improving software quality and reducing risk, {eid: 84942757453}>, <Techniques for improving regression testing in continuous integration development environments, {eid: 84986877429}>, <Regression test selection and product line system testing, {eid: 77954527991}>, <Goal-oriented test case selection and prioritization for product line feature models, {eid: 80051528149}>, <Validation of constraints among configuration parameters using search-based combinatorial interaction testing, {eid: 84989813040}>, <Test prioritization in continuous integration environments, {eid: 85053760573, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2018.08.061}>, <Automating system test case classification and prioritization for use case-driven testing in product lines, {eid: 85089602675}>, <Automated code-based test selection for software product line regression testing, {eid: 85072228048, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2019.110419}>, <Rajkumar: Test case prioritization techniques for software product line: A survey, {eid: 85011114125}>, <Risk-based integration testing of software product lines, {eid: 85014902435}>, <Delta-oriented test case prioritization for integration testing of software product lines, {eid: 84982811054}>, <Adaptive operator selection with bandits for a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, {eid: 84893865972}>, <Retest test selection for product-line regression testing of variants and versions of variants, {eid: 85054466985}>, <Incremental model-based testing of delta-oriented software product lines, {eid: 84862204405}>, <On a test of whether one of two random variables is stochastically larger than the other, {eid: 0002322469}>, <Multi-perspective regression test prioritization for time-constrained environments, {eid: 84962091042}>, <A learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration development and testing practice, {eid: 85056634616}>, <A learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration development and testing practice, {eid: 85056634616}>, <Test case prioritization for continuous regression testing: An industrial case study, {eid: 84891715780}>, <Test prioritization with optimally balanced configuration coverage, {eid: 85019254116}>, <Titan: Test suite optimization for highly configurable software, {eid: 85020723577}>, <A comparison of 10 sampling algorithms for configurable systems, {eid: 84971414235}>, <Discipline matters: Refactoring of preprocessor directives in the #ifdef hell, {eid: 85047010689}>, <Tackling combinatorial explosion: A study of industrial needs and practices for analyzing highly configurable systems, {eid: 85056534298}>, <On the evolution of feature dependencies: An exploratory study of preprocessor-based systems, {eid: 85123042832}>, <Stability of Product-Line Sampling in Continuous Integration.

Accelerating their maintenance and continuous improvement, while ensuring their availability, is complex. DevOps promotes fast and continuous feedback from operations to development to detect problems before customers are impacted, among other benefits. However, there is not any formal definition of how to do this. This article defines the 'fast and continuous monitoring feedback of system availability' activity (FCF availability) that supports automatic and continuous monitoring feedback from operations to the development of the IoT system availability. This activity has been formalized through the software and systems process engineering metamodel (SPEM). Its implementation is demonstrated in a real scenario that provides evidence that the formalization of the FCF availability activity helps teams in better diagnosing and fixing outage problems. The result is a distributed and configurable monitoring component developed through code [monitoring as code (MaC)]. This component is embedded in the IoT infrastructure. MaC enables DevOps team to configure their own metrics and indicators at runtime, i.e., monitoring on demand. The formalization of this activity, based on an MaC technique, enables the automation, versioning, and replication of monitoring elements.","Availability, continuous monitoring, DevOps, fast and continuous feedback activity, Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems",,,,,,,,"<Understanding the Internet of Things: Definition, potentials, and societal role of a fast evolving paradigm, {eid: 85009285034}>, <Introduction to the internet of things, {eid: 84956476081, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-40403-0}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <None, {eid: 85173029256}>, <Current and future challenges of software engineering for services and applications, {eid: 84998698759}>, <Relationship of DevOps to agile, lean and continuous deployment, {eid: 84999040028}>, <An exploratory study of DevOps extending the dimensions of DevOps with practices, {eid: 84998881112}>, <Towards definitions for release engineering and DevOps, {eid: 84962216125}>, <None, {eid: 85018529770}>, <Towards DevOps in the embedded systems domain: Why is it so hard?, {eid: 84975460866}>, <Agile processes: Challenges and strategies for undertaking continuous experimentation to embedded systems: Industry and research perspectives, {eid: 85048052155}>, <None, {eid: 77949517037}>, <A qualitative study of DevOps usage in practice, {eid: 85021358087}>, <Introduction to the minitrack on IT governance and its mechanisms, {eid: 85060475722}>, <None, {eid: 85073237331}>, <None, {eid: 84903828209}>, <A survey of commercial frameworks for the Internet of Things, {eid: 84952907595}>, <A survey of IoT cloud platforms, {eid: 85033708211}>, <None, {eid: 85092728057}>, <None, {eid: 84963757817}>, <None, {eid: 84958964990}>, <Fog computing and its role in the Internet of Things characterization of fog computing, {eid: 84866627419}>, <Future Internet: The Internet of Things architecture, possible applications and key challenges, {eid: 84874174122}>, <Fog computing: Platform and applications, {eid: 84969509112}>, <IFCIoT: Integrated fog cloud IoT: A novel architectural paradigm for the future Internet of Things, {eid: 85021058978}>, <INDICES: Exploiting edge resources for performanceaware cloud-hosted services, {eid: 85027465225}>, <Agile infrastructure and operations: How infra-gile are you?, {eid: 52949150488}>, <Toward unified DevOps model, {eid: 84958247265}>, <Key affordances of platform- asa-service: Self-organization and continuous feedback, {eid: 85055527652}>, <Microservices architecture enables DevOps: Migration to a cloud-native architecture, {eid: 84968796741}>, <Selfservice cybersecurity monitoring as enabler for DevSecOps, {eid: 85084859519}>, <ENACT: Development, operation, and quality assurance of trustworthy smart IoT systems, {eid: 85092710058}>, <DevOps for IoT applications using cellular networks and cloud, {eid: 84992036313}>, <Enabling operation data visibility for SmartX-MINI IoT-cloud playground, {eid: 84979996132}>, <Automated deployment of SmartX IoTcloud services based on continuous integration, {eid: 85015804380}>, <Cloud ecosystems support for Internet of Things and DevOps using patterns, {eid: 84977609466}>, <None, {eid: 85092739167}>, <Reliability and availability evaluation of wireless sensor networks for industrial applications, {eid: 84856247989}>, <None, {eid: 0003673547}>, <A documentation framework for architecture decisions, {eid: 84857356116}>, <Qualitative methods in empirical studies of software engineering, {eid: 0033163750}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2020-10-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85092738657

Operators can configure, monitor, or control the industrial production process remotely via Internet, which brings security threats to IIoTs. Since the IIoT focuses on the availability of industrial production, it is unfeasible to study security issues directly on the industrial field. Thus, constructing an IIoT cyber range to reproduce industrial scenarios for offensive and defensive confrontation research is necessary. However, the traditional IIoT cyber range relies on physical industrial field devices that are not reproducible and hard to recover from cyber-attacks. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose a framework for a digital twin-based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models.

Unsurprisingly, Machine Learning (ML) applications in AM technologies have been increasingly growing in the past several years. The trend is driven by the ability of data-driven techniques to support a range of AM concerns, including in-process monitoring and predictions. However, despite numerous ML applications being reported for different AM concerns, no framework exists to systematically manage these ML models for AM operations in the industry. Moreover, no guidance exists on fundamental requirements to realize such a cross-disciplinary platform. Working with experts in ML and AM, this work identifies the fundamental requirements to realize a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) platform to support process-based ML models for industrial metal AM (MAM). Project-level activities are identified in terms of functional roles, processes, systems, operations, and interfaces. These components are discussed in detail and are linked with their respective requirements. In this regard, peer-reviewed references to identified requirements are made available. The requirements identified can help guide small and medium enterprises looking to implement ML solutions for AM in the industry. Challenges and opportunities for such a system are highlighted. The system can be expanded to include other lifecycle phases of metallic and non-metallic AM.","Computing infrastructure, Data analytics and machine learning, Fundamental and functional requirements,

They are formulated as a network of interacting cyberspace and physical elements. Dealing with this new industrial context, distributed control systems (DCS) are increasingly involved because they permit meeting flexibility and adaptability requirements, which can give scope to CPS. The product driven control system (PDS) is considered as DCS in which the product plays a major role in decision-making. However, the PDS paradigm has not yet received sufficient attention within the CPS. Relying on multi-agents system as implementation framework, radio frequency identity as auto-identity technologies, and hardware in the loop simulation as a practical methodology, the paper proposes a validation and practical framework of PDS applied to the highly automated flexible robotized assembly system. An efficient CPS is developed for a discrete flexible manufacturing system.","Cyber-physical systems, Distributed control system, Hardware in the loop simulation, Multi-agents system, Product driven

Previous work has shown the utility of such automatically generated invariants as a means for updating and completing system specifications; they also are useful as a means of understanding model behavior. This work shows how the scalability and accuracy of the data mining process can be dramatically improved by using information from data/control flow analysis to reduce the search space of the invariant mining and to eliminate false positives. Comparative evaluations of the process show that the improvements significantly reduce execution time and memory consumption, thereby supporting the analysis of more complex models, while also improving the accuracy of the generated invariants.","Automated test generation, Invariant mining, Model-based development, Verification and validation",,,,,,,,"<Automatic requirement extraction from test cases, {eid: 78650130252}>, <Semantic translation of simulink/stateflow models to hybrid automata using graph transformations, {eid: 10444269559}>, <Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, {eid: 0027621699}>, <On the complexity of mining association rules, {eid: 3142659104}>, <Mining temporal invariants from partially ordered logs, {eid: 81055155516}>, <Simulation-directed invariant mining for software verification, {eid: 49749119976}>, <None, {eid: 84963820509}>, <The daikon system for dynamic detection of likely invariants, {eid: 35348872682}>, <None, {eid: 85030694687}>, <The SPMF open-source data mining library version 2, {eid: 84988603099}>, <Artshop: A continuous integration and quality assessment framework for model-based software artifacts, {eid: 84996742929}>, <Similarity measures in scientometric research: The jaccard index versus saltons cosine formula, {eid: 0024904643}>, <Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation, {eid: 0039253846}>, <Real-time heart model for implantable cardiac device validation and verification, {eid: 77958454649}>, <Modular code generation from synchronous block diagrams: Modularity vs. Code size, {eid: 67649868329}>, <Modular code generation fromtriggered and timed block diagrams, {eid: 51249100059}>, <Modularity vs. Reusability: Code generation fromsynchronous block diagrams, {eid: 49749123427}>, <Tool for translating simulink models into input language of a model checker, {eid: 33845247797}>, <Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained associations rules, {eid: 0032092760}>, <A toolset for simulink: Improving software engineering practices in development with simulink, {eid: 84939537353}>, <Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints, {eid: 0035016447}>, <GoldMine: Automatic assertion generation using data mining and static analysis, {eid: 77953089806}>, <None, {eid: 0003639957}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2017-09-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85030672741

These models may get broken due to various editions throughout their life-cycle. There are already approaches that provide an automatic repair of models, however, the same issues might not have the same solutions in all contexts due to different user preferences and business policies. Personalization would enhance the usability of automatic repairs in different contexts, and by reusing the experience from previous repairs we would avoid duplicated calculations when facing similar issues. By using reinforcement learning we have achieved the repair of broken models allowing both automation and personalization of results. In this paper, we propose transfer learning to reuse the experience learned from each model repair. We have validated our approach by repairing models using different sets of personalization preferences and studying how the repair time improved when reusing the experience from each repair.","Model repair, Reinforcement learning, Transfer learning",,,,,,,,"<Amor-towards adaptable model versioning, {eid: 79956310521}>, <None, {eid: 85075955114}>, <Apprenticeship learning via inverse reinforcement learning, {eid: 14344251217}>, <None, {eid: 85089507410}>, <Algorithms for hyper-parameter optimization, {eid: 85162384813}>, <Quality-driven detection and resolution of metamodel smells, {eid: 85061749093}>, <None, {eid: 34547932110}>, <Automatic model repair using reinforcement learning, {eid: 85063099879}>, <Personalized and automatic model repairing using reinforcement learning, {eid: 85075917035}>, <None, {eid: 85089540176}>, <None, {eid: 79953812664}>, <Interactive and incremental business process model repair, {eid: 85032666523}>, <Assessing uml model quality by utilizing metrics, {eid: 85061337719}>, <None, {eid: 84876381003}>, <An automated and instant discovery of concrete repairs for model inconsistencies, {eid: 85049674679}>, <Detecting and exploring side effects when repairing model inconsistencies, {eid: 85076794544}>, <Search-based detection of model level changes, {eid: 84988735029}>, <Assessing the quality of meta-models, {eid: 84911484484}>, <None, {eid: 85075956634}>, <Model repair and transformation with echo, {eid: 84893569792}>, <A feature-based classification of model repair approaches, {eid: 85029226586}>, <Rule-based repair of emf models: An automated interactive approach, {eid: 85025137338}>, <None, {eid: 85075941591}>, <Revision: A tool for history-based model repair recommendations, {eid: 85049665911}>, <Resolving model inconsistencies using automated regression planning, {eid: 84922337776}>, <A survey on transfer learning, {eid: 77956031473}>, <Computing repair trees for resolving inconsistencies in design models, {eid: 84866911610}>, <None, {eid: 0004007508}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <Change-preserving model repair, {eid: 85016408527}>, <Transfer learning, {eid: 84866381873}>, <The state of practice in model-driven engineering, {eid: 84899687758}>",,,Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets,,,2020-07-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85089499795

Family-based behavioral modeling paves the way for efficient model-based analysis of software product lines. Family-based behavioral model learning incorporates feature model analysis and model learning principles to efficiently unify product models into a family model and integrate the behavior of various products into a behavioral family model. Albeit reasonably effective, the exhaustive analysis of product lines is often infeasible due to the potentially exponential number of valid configurations. In this paper, we first present a family-based behavioral model learning techniques, called FFSMDiff. Subsequently, we report on our experience on learning family models by employing product sampling. Using 105 products of six product lines expressed in terms of Mealy machines, we evaluate the precision of family models learned from products selected from different settings of the T-wise product sampling criterion. We show that product sampling can lead to models as precise as those learned by exhaustive analysis and hence, reduce the costs for family model learning.","Family model, Model learning, Software product lines, T-wise sampling",,,,,,,,"<Automata learning through counterexample guided abstraction refinement, {eid: 84866000299}>, <Model learning and model-based testing, {eid: 85051109384}>, <Incling: Efficient product-line testing using incremental pairwise sampling, {eid: 85084189184}>, <Delta-oriented product prioritization for similarity-based product-line testing, {eid: 85027114086}>, <Matching UML class diagrams using a hybridized greedy-genetic algorithm, {eid: 85040780347}>, <Reverse engineering feature models from software configurations using formal concept analysis, {eid: 84961377139}>, <Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples, {eid: 0023453626, doi: 10.1016/0890-5401(87)90052-6}>, <None, {eid: 84979494516}>, <Exploring feature interactions in the wild: The new feature-interaction challenge, {eid: 84890043412}>, <A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, {eid: 79959871222}>, <Formal description of variability in product families, {eid: 80054070983}>, <A compositional framework to derive product line behavioural descriptions, {eid: 84868275563}>, <Merging features in featured transition systems, {eid: 84960970353}>, <None, {eid: 51949106265}>, <Analyzing program behavior through active automata learning, {eid: 84906948261, doi: 10.1007/s10009-014-0333-2}>, <Automated analysis of feature models 20 years later: a literature review, {eid: 77955227439, doi: 10.1016/j.is.2010.01.001}>, <A survey on modeling techniques for formal behavioral verification of software product lines, {eid: 84961245105}>, <Input–output conformance testing for software product lines, {eid: 85008682089, doi: 10.1016/j.jlamp.2016.09.007}>, <Basic behavioral models for software product lines: expressiveness and testing pre-orders, {eid: 84937604468, doi: 10.1016/j.scico.2015.06.005}>, <A study of variability models and languages in the systems software domain, {eid: 84890065386, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2013.34}>, <Similarity testing for access control, {eid: 84914157978, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2014.07.003}>, <When 150 % is too much: Supporting product centric viewpoints in an industrial product line, {eid: 84991628008}>, <Intraprocedural dataflow analysis for software product lines, {eid: 84860443937}>, <Part i.

Modeling and Simulation as a Service (MSaaS), as a new paradigm, supports sharing simulation models or modeling tools and has enabled a wide range of model reuse. However, reusing or combining some immature models may result in inefficient M&S activities or even false simulation results. To make sure the appropriate reuse and composition of simulation models in cloud environments, which is also termed as model service composition for simulation (MSCS), this paper incorporates model maturity with service cooperation as a metric to evaluate the quality of model composition in cloud. Then, as a multi-objective optimization problem with multiple constraints, the MSCS problem and its process are described in detail. To solve the MSCS problem, a novel evolutionary algorithm named CA-AO-NSGAII is proposed. In the algorithm, adaptive crossover and mutation operators, as well as probabilistic initialization are developed. Furthermore, a half-local search algorithm in an elitist mechanism is designed for efficient decision-making. To validate the performance of CA-AO-NSGAII, experiments with respect to four different cases are conducted. Results show that the proposed method for addressing MSCS issue is effective and feasible.","Cloud computing, Evolutionary algorithm, Model maturity, Model service composition for simulation (MSCS), Modeling and simulation (M&S), MSaaS",,,,,,,,"<DEVS/SOA: A cross-platform framework for net-centric modeling and simulation in DEVS unified process, {eid: 67650606762}>, <A DEVS Based Modelling and Methodology-COSIM, {eid: 84896873864}>, <A Survey and Preliminary Research on Service Federation Based Modeling and Simulation, {eid: 84962081992}>, <A review of Web-based simulation and supporting tools, {eid: 74449088143}>, <Networked Modeling & Simulation Platform Based on Concept of Cloud Computing Cloud Simulation Platform, {eid: 70349400264}>, <None, {eid: 85113278460}>, <Modeling and simulation as a cloud service: a survey, {eid: 84894157608}>, <SimSaaS: simulation software-as-a-service, {eid: 84896330895}>, <Model maturity towards modeling and simulation: Concepts, index system framework and evaluation method, {eid: 85086280964}>, <Optimal Operation of Active Distribution Grids: a System of Systems Framework, {eid: 84899961551}>, <Real-time load balancing scheduling algorithm for periodic simulation models, {eid: 85027930932}>, <A Practical Guide to SysML: The Systems Modeling Language.

At the same time, this also introduced continuous delivery practices to the development of software components for network-connected gateways and sensing/actuating nodes. These devices are placed on end users’ premises and are characterized by continuously changing cyber-physical contexts, forcing software developers to maintain multiple application versions and frequently redeploy them on a distributed fleet of devices with respect to their current contexts. Doing this correctly and efficiently goes beyond manual capabilities and requires an intelligent and reliable automated solution. This paper describes a model-based approach to automatically assigning multiple software deployment plans to hundreds of edge gateways and connected IoT devices implemented in collaboration with a smart healthcare application provider. From a platform-specific model of an existing edge computing platform, we extract a platform-independent model that describes a list of target devices and a pool of available deployment plans. Next, we use constraint solving to automatically assign deployment plans to devices at once with respect to their specific contexts. The result is transformed back into the platform-specific model and includes a suitable deployment plan for each device, which is then consumed by our engine to deploy software components not only on edge gateways but also on their downstream IoT devices with constrained resources and connectivity. We validate the approach with a fleet deployment prototype integrated into a DevOps toolchain used by the partner application provider. Initial experiments demonstrate the viability of the approach and its usefulness in supporting DevOps for edge and IoT software development.","Constraint solving, Device fleet, DevOps, IoT,

We investigate how the inherent encapsulation of component and connector (C&C) architectures can be used to develop and deploy reliable IoT applications. Existing C&C languages for the development of IoT applications mainly focus on the description of architectures and the distribution of components to IoT devices. Furthermore, related approaches often pollute the models with low-level implementation details, tying the models to a particular platform and making them harder to understand. In this paper, we introduce MontiThings, a C&C language offering automatic error handling capabilities and a clear separation between business logic and implementation details. The error-handling methods presented in this paper can make C&C-based IoT applications more reliable without cluttering the business logic with error-handling code that is time-consuming to develop and makes the models hard to understand, especially for non-experts.","Architecture modeling, Code generation, Deployment, Internet of Things, Model-driven engineering",,,,,,,,"<Model-driven separation of concerns for service robotics, {eid: 85015193041}>, <Enterprise information systems in academia and practice: Lessons learned from a MBSE project, {eid: 85115262972}>, <On the deployment of IoT systems: An industrial survey, {eid: 85085747272}>, <Requirement-based deployment of applications in Calvin, {eid: 85018622215}>, <MSL: A pattern language for engineering self-adaptive systems, {eid: 85080064786}>, <Integrated data management for a fleet of search-and-rescue robots, {eid: 84978500286}>, <Situational context in the programmable world, {eid: 85050184835}>, <Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with Xtext and Xtend, {eid: 84906918277}>, <Modern Control Systems Analysis and Design using MATLAB and SIMULINK, {eid: 0004064857}>, <Toward a distributed data flow platform for the web of things (distributed node-RED), {eid: 84984984329}>, <A component architecture for the internet of things, {eid: 85045755257}>, <Specification and Development of Interactive Systems.

In the O-RAN specifications, the RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) are software-defined orchestration and automation functions for the intelligent management of RAN. This article introduces principles for machine learning (ML), in particular, reinforcement learning (RL) applications in the O-RAN stack. Furthermore, we review the state-of-the-art research in wireless networks and cast it onto the RAN framework and the hierarchy of the O-RAN architecture. We provide a taxonomy for the challenges faced by ML/RL models throughout the development life-cycle: from the system specification to production deployment (data acquisition, model design, testing and management, etc.). To address the challenges, we integrate a set of existing MLOps principles with unique characteristics when RL agents are considered. This paper discusses a systematic model development, testing and validation life-cycle, termed: RLOps. We discuss fundamental parts of RLOps, which include: model specification, development, production environment serving, operations monitoring and safety/security. Based on these principles, we propose the best practices for RLOps to achieve an automated and reproducible model development process. At last, a holistic data analytics platform rooted in the O-RAN deployment is designed and implemented, aiming to embrace and fulfil the aforementioned principles and best practices of RLOps.","data

As a consequence, the system administration procedures are becoming more complex and time-consuming, especially if done manually. In this paper, a Semantic Model driven Approach to Deployment and Adaptivity of container-based applications in Fog Computing (SMADA-Fog) is proposed. Modeling tools, semantic framework, linear optimization model, simulation environment and infrastructure management code generator leveraging the semantic annotations are implemented and presented. According to results of the two experimentally tested scenarios, the proposed approach improves the application performance, while the time required for deployment as well as service adaptation is reduced for at least an order of magnitude.","DevOps, Fog Computing, Infrastructure as code, Linear optimization, Model-driven engineering, Semantic technology",,,,,,,,"<A research perspective on fog computing, {eid: 85049018742, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-91764-1_16}>, <Information logistics and fog computing: the DITAS approach, {eid: 85020533059}>, <Simulating fog and edge computing scenarios: an overview and research challenges, {eid: 85063588970, doi: 10.3390/fi11030055}>, <An aspect-oriented framework for service adaptation, {eid: 77149169725, doi: 10.1007/11948148_2}>, <Adaptive wireless video streaming based on edge computing: opportunities and approaches, {eid: 85045740301, doi: 10.1109/TSC.2018.2828426}>, <Adaptation of service-based systems, service research challenges and solutions for the future Internet, {eid: 79956134701, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-17599-2_5}>, <Enabling Flexibility of Data-Intensive Applications on Container-Based Systems with Node-RED in Fog Environments, Master Thesis, {eid: 85067346514}>, <A containerized big data streaming architecture for edge cloud computing on clustered single-board devices, {eid: 85067470840, doi: 10.5220/0007695000680080}>, <Infrastructure as Code: Managing Servers in the Cloud, {eid: 85026761147}>, <DevOps, {eid: 84968831988, doi: 10.1109/ms.2016.68}>, <Infrastructure-as-code for data-intensive architectures: a model-driven development approach, {eid: 85051103640, doi: 10.1109/ICSA.2018.00025}>, <Formalisation of Information Systems Modelling (thesis), {eid: 0004119079}>, <Toward principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge sharing, {eid: 58149365542}>, <Unified IoT ontology to enable interoperability and federation of testbeds, {eid: 85015182893}>, <Semantic driven code generation for networking testbed experimentation, {eid: 85053036166, doi: 10.1080/17517575.2018.1509135}>, <The SCOR ontologies framework for robotics testbed, {eid: 85062056944, doi: 10.1109/telfor.2018.8611841}>, <A semantic framework for design-time RIoT device mission coordination, {eid: 85062088297, doi: 10.1109/telfor.2018.8611845}>, <Formalizing device coordination in IoT systems: the SCOR case study, {eid: 85076552257}>, <Linear Programming 1 -

This enables fast and frequent releases in the sense of continuously delivering new iterations of a particular application. Users and customers of today's Web applications and mobile apps running in the Cloud expect fast feedback to problems and feature requests. Thus, it is a critical competitive advantage to be able to respond quickly. Besides cultural and organizational changes that are necessary to apply DevOps in practice, tooling is required to implement end-to-end automation of deployment processes. Automation is the key to efficient collaboration and tight integration between development and operations. The DevOps community is constantly pushing new approaches, tools, and open-source artifacts to implement such automated processes. However, as all these proprietary and heterogeneous DevOps automation approaches differ from each other, it is hard to integrate and combine them to deploy applications in the Cloud using an automated deployment process. In this paper we present a systematic classification of DevOps artifacts and show how different kinds of artifacts can be discovered and transformed toward TOSCA, which is an emerging standard. We present an integrated modeling and runtime framework to enable the seamless and interoperable integration of different approaches to model and deploy application topologies. The framework is implemented by an open-source, end-to-end toolchain. Moreover, we validate and evaluate the presented approach to show its practical feasibility based on a detailed case study, in particular considering the performance of the transformation toward TOSCA.","Cloud computing, Cloud standards, Deployment automation, DevOps, TOSCA, Transformation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84887309406}>, <None, {eid: 84860316008}>, <None, {eid: 84858197925}>, <None, {eid: 84884493217}>, <None, {eid: 84923681810}>, <None, {eid: 84978418140}>, <None, {eid: 84958809022}>, <Standards-based DevOps automation and integration using TOSCA, {eid: 84946692273}>, <None, {eid: 84941941478}>, <TOSCA: Portable automated deployment and management of cloud applications, {eid: 84930424951}>, <The Emergence of governance in an open source community, {eid: 36749092836}>, <A framework for creating hybrid-open source software communities, {eid: 0036108945}>, <Any2API - Automated APIfication, {eid: 84969848923}>, <Container-based operating system virtualization: A scalable, high-performance alternative to hypervisors, {eid: 34548029519}>, <None, {eid: 84923681808}>, <None, {eid: 84958809023}>, <None, {eid: 84884482931}>, <None, {eid: 84880300218}>, <None, {eid: 84908235036}>, <None, {eid: 78651521953}>, <None, {eid: 77957994724}>, <BPMN4TOSCA: A domain-specific language to model management plans for composite applications, {eid: 84870341884}>, <Automated capturing and systematic usage of DevOps knowledge for cloud applications, {eid: 84944329323}>, <None, {eid: 84944333558}>, <Integrating configuration management with model-driven cloud management based on TOSCA, {eid: 84884491041}>, <None, {eid: 84863232801}>, <None, {eid: 84893925034}>, <Winery - A modeling tool for TOSCA-based cloud applications, {eid: 84892397400}>, <OpenTOSCA - A runtime for TOSCA-based cloud applications, {eid: 84892400015}>, <None, {eid: 58149225100}>, <None, {eid: 0004002692}>, <None, {eid: 84899456507}>, <Combining declarative and imperative cloud application provisioning based on TOSCA, {eid: 84908563698}>, <Unified invocation of scripts and services for provisioning, deployment, and management of cloud applications based on TOSCA, {eid: 84902315977}>, <None, {eid: 84958809025}>, <Blueprinting the Cloud, {eid: 80555156126}>, <None, {eid: 84923681804}>, <None, {eid: 84907080574}>, <Sr DevOpSlang - Bridging the gap between development and operations, {eid: 84923681803}>, <Ubicrawler: A scalable fully distributed web crawler, {eid: 3042680184}>, <Mercator: A scalable, extensible web crawler, {eid: 79951675059}>, <The social compute unit, {eid: 79955550220}>, <The rise of crowdsourcing, {eid: 33847246935}>, <None, {eid: 0344990694}>, <None, {eid: 78651322278}>",,,Elsevier,,,2016-03-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-84958740530

All rights reserved.Context: Testing complex industrial robots (CIRs) requires testing several interacting control systems. This is challenging, especially for robots performing process-intensive tasks such as painting or gluing, since their dedicated process control systems can be loosely coupled with the robot's motion control. Objective: Current practices for validating CIRs involve manual test case design and execution. To reduce testing costs and improve quality assurance, a trend is to automate the generation of test cases. Our work aims to define a cost-effective automated testing technique to validate CIR control systems in an industrial context. Method: This paper reports on a methodology, developed at ABB Robotics in collaboration with SIMULA, for the fully automated testing of CIRs control systems. Our approach draws on continuous integration principles and well-established constraint-based testing techniques. It is based on a novel constraintbased model for automatically generating test sequences where test sequences are both generated and executed as part of a continuous integration process. Results: By performing a detailed analysis of experimental results over a simplified version of our constraint model, we determine the most appropriate parameterization of the operational version of the constraint model. This version is now being deployed at ABB Robotics's CIR testing facilities and used on a permanent basis. This paper presents the empirical results obtained when automatically generating test sequences for CIRs at ABB Robotics. In a real industrial setting, the results show that our methodology is not only able to detect reintroduced known faults, but also to spot completely new faults. Conclusion: Our empirical evaluation shows that constraint-based testing is appropriate for automatically generating test sequences for CIRs and can be faithfully deployed in an industrial context.","Agile development, Constraint programming, Continuous integration, Distributed real time systems, Robotized painting, Software testing",,,,,,,,"<Test generation for robotized paint systems using constraint programming in a continuous integration environment, {eid: 84883352915}>, <None, {eid: 0003426802}>, <None, {eid: 0006705483}>, <Continuous software engineering and beyond: Trends and challenges, {eid: 84942514935}>, <Communicating continuous integration servers for increasing effectiveness of automated testing, {eid: 84866917846}>, <Software testing: A research travelogue 2000-2014, {eid: 84942057973}>, <Empirical studies of test case prioritization in a JUnit testing environment, {eid: 16244385003}>, <A new heuristic for test suite reduction, {eid: 0032115945}>, <Test case prioritization for continuous regression testing: An industrial case study, {eid: 84891715780}>, <Unit test virtualization with vmvm, {eid: 84994138689}>, <On-demand test suite reduction, {eid: 84864269921}>, <CiCUTS: Combining system execution modeling tools with continuous integration environments, {eid: 44149100080}>, <A programming model for time-synchronized distributed real-time systems, {eid: 34548134817}>, <The control of discrete event systems, {eid: 0024479313}>, <None, {eid: 84892236938}>, <Ieee-1588 standard for a precision clock synchronization protocol for networked measurement and control systems, {eid: 4544372422}>, <Time synchronization in a local area network, {eid: 1842680834}>, <Cyber-physical systems: The next computing revolution, {eid: 77956217277}>, <Cyber-physical systems: A new frontier, {eid: 84892198803}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Crosslayer analysis testing and verification of automotive control software, {eid: 80455179700}>, <None, {eid: 85013703606}>, <Specification and verification: The spec# experience, {eid: 79959994169}>, <Automatic test data generation using constraint solving techniques, {eid: 84951817396}>, <Test selection strategies for lustre descriptions in gatel, {eid: 11244264152}>, <Stress testing of task deadlines: A constraint programming approach, {eid: 84893212634}>, <Goal-oriented test data generation for pointer programs, {eid: 34347374293}>, <Stress testing of task deadlines: A constraint programming approach, {eid: 84893212634}>, <Test architectures for testing distributed systems, {eid: 57349196017}>, <None, {eid: 84922566253}>, <Python reference manual, {eid: 0013153953}>, <A taxonomy of model-based testing approaches, {eid: 84862325128}>, <None, {eid: 0003683967}>, <None, {eid: 33748706709}>, <Z3: An efficient SMT solver, {eid: 45749085681}>, <Search-based software test data generation: A survey, {eid: 3142725712}>, <None, {eid: 82955189952}>, <An open-ended finite domain constraint solver, {eid: 84923057783}>, <Optimisation modelling for software developers, {eid: 84868266728}>, <The future of optimization technology, {eid: 84902474528}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2015-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-84922513915

CPSs with this feature are named Self-Healing CPSs (SH-CPSs). SH-CPSs detect and recover from errors caused by hardware or software faults at runtime and handle uncertainties arising from their interactions with environments. Therefore, it is critical to test if SH-CPSs can still behave as expected under uncertainties. By testing an SH-CPS in various conditions and learning from testing results, reinforcement learning algorithms can gradually optimize their testing policies and apply the policies to detect failures, i.e., cases that the SH-CPS fails to behave as expected. However, there is insufficient evidence to know which reinforcement learning algorithms perform the best in terms of testing SH-CPSs behaviors including their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. To this end, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the performance of 14 combinations of reinforcement learning algorithms, with two value function learning based methods for operation invocations and seven policy optimization based algorithms for introducing uncertainties. Experimental results reveal that the 14 combinations of the algorithms achieved similar coverage of system states and transitions, and the combination of Q-learning and Uncertainty Policy Optimization (UPO) detected the most failures among the 14 combinations. On average, the Q-Learning and UPO combination managed to discover two times more failures than the others. Meanwhile, the combination took 52% less time to find a failure. Regarding scalability, the time and space costs of the value function learning based methods grow, as the number of states and transitions of the system under test increases. In contrast, increasing the system’s complexity has little impact on policy optimization based algorithms.","Cyber-physical systems, Empirical evaluation, Model execution, Reinforcement learning, Self-healing, Uncertainty",,,,,,,,"<Generating test data from OCL constraints with search techniques, {eid: 84884878316, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2013.17}>, <None, {eid: 85042614022}>, <Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing, {eid: 0001677717}>, <Model-based fault diagnosis and reconfiguration of robot drives, {eid: 51349162241}>, <Model-based hypothesis testing of uncertain software systems, {eid: 85079042885}>, <Automated test sequence generation for finite state machines using genetic algorithms, {eid: 52249113028}>, <Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control, {eid: 85019241632}>, <Multiple comparisons using rank sums, {eid: 84861604521, doi: 10.1080/00401706.1964.10490181}>, <Lightweight automated testing with adaptation-based programming, 2012 IEEE 23rd international symposium on software reliability engineering, {eid: 84876394399, doi: 10.1109/ISSRE.2012.1}>, <Safety and dependability analysis of self-adaptive systems, second international symposium on leveraging applications of formal methods, {eid: 77956422483}>, <Deep reinforcement learning that matters.

It is important to test whether self-healing behaviors can correctly heal faults under uncertainties to ensure their reliability. However, the autonomy of self-healing behaviors and impact of uncertainties make it challenging to conduct such testing. To this end, we devise a fragility-oriented testing approach, which is comprised of two novel algorithms: fragility-oriented testing (FOT) and uncertainty policy optimization (UPO). The two algorithms utilize the fragility, obtained from test executions, to learn the optimal policies for invoking operations and introducing uncertainties, respectively, to effectively detect faults. We evaluated their performance by comparing them against a coverage-oriented testing (COT) algorithm and a random uncertainty generation method (R). The evaluation results showed that the fault detection ability of FOT+UPO was significantly higher than the ones of FOT+R, COT+UPO, and COT+R, in 73 out of 81 cases. In the 73 cases, FOT+UPO detected more than 70% of faults, while the others detected 17% of faults, at the most.","Cyber-physical systems, Model execution, Reinforcement learning, Self-healing, Uncertainty",,,,,,,,"<Generating test data from OCL constraints with search techniques, {eid: 84884878316, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2013.17}>, <None, {eid: 0003844191}>, <Intelligent agent-based stimulation for testing robotic software in human-robot interactions, {eid: 85030683872}>, <A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, {eid: 79959871222}>, <None, {eid: 0003655704}>, <None, {eid: 85042614022}>, <A survey on testing for cyber physical system, {eid: 84952786814}>, <Software engineering for smart cyber-physical systems--towards a research agenda: report on the First International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart CPS, {eid: 84993962773, doi: 10.1145/2830719.2830736}>, <On-the-fly conformance testing using SPIN, {eid: 84896693311, doi: 10.1007/s100090050044}>, <Model and object verification by using Dresden OCL, {eid: 79951889367}>, <Benchmarking deep reinforcement learning for continuous control, {eid: 85019241632}>, <A controlled experiment in testing of safety-critical embedded software, {eid: 84983326093}>, <Uncertainty in self-adaptive software systems, {eid: 84883580334}>, <Towards run-time adaptation of test cases for self-adaptive systems in the face of uncertainty, {eid: 84903746086}>, <Importance sampling for stochastic simulations, {eid: 0001240715, doi: 10.1287/mnsc.35.11.1367}>, <Model-based testing in practice, {eid: 85054050987}>, <Lightweight automated testing with adaptation-based programming, {eid: 84876394399}>, <Methods of conjugate gradients for solving linear systems, {eid: 0000135303, doi: 10.6028/jres.049.044}>, <Reinforcement learning: a survey, {eid: 0029679044, doi: 10.1613/jair.301}>, <Approximately optimal approximate reinforcement learning, {eid: 1942514728}>, <Online testing of real-time systems using uppaal, {eid: 67349165874}>, <None, {eid: 85029416652}>, <Fragility-oriented testing with model execution and reinforcement learning, {eid: 85030696798}>, <Modeling foundations for executable model-based testing of self-healing cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85068943818}>, <None, {eid: 0003830923}>, <A taxonomy of uncertainty for dynamically adaptive systems, {eid: 84865127075}>, <Trust region policy optimization, {eid: 84969963490}>, <Current challenges in the verification of hybrid systems, {eid: 84952657055}>, <None, {eid: 0004102479}>, <Moka–a simulation platform for Papyrus based on OMG specifications for executable UML, {eid: 85057527028}>, <A taxonomy of model-based testing approaches, {eid: 84862325128, doi: 10.1002/stvr.456}>, <Online testing with reinforcement learning, {eid: 43049140624}>, <None, {eid: 84949178783, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-29044-2}>, <Verifying self-adaptive applications suffering uncertainty, {eid: 84908608579}>, <None, {eid: 0004312284}>, <Understanding uncertainty in cyber-physical systems: A conceptual model, {eid: 85063200977}>, <None, {eid: 85014574153}>, <Verification and validation in cyber physical systems: Research challenges and a way forward, {eid: 84946222990}>",,,Springer New York LLC,,,2019-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85063237133

Unfortunately, learning such global behaviors can be inaccurate and slow for systems composed of heterogeneous elements, which behave very differently, for instance as it is the case for cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things applications. Instead, to make smart decisions, such systems have to continuously refine the behavior on a per-element basis and compose these small learning units together. However, combining and composing learned behaviors from different elements is challenging and requires domain knowledge. Therefore, there is a need to structure and combine the learned behaviors and domain knowledge together in a flexible way. In this paper we propose to weave machine learning into domain modeling. More specifically, we suggest to decompose machine learning into reusable, chainable, and independently computable small learning units, which we refer to as microlearning units.

One of the core practices of DevOps is the use of pipelines to enable CI/CD to make teams more Agile and break down the barriers between development and operations with faster deployments. Current MDE tooling is not designed at its core to participate in DevOps pipelines. Consequently this makes the adoption of MDE in industry more difficult. In this article, we cover an industrial experience report describing how we enabled our pipelines using DevOps and MDE.","Agile, Ant, CI/CD, DevOps, Eclipse, EMF, MDE, Model-driven engineering",,,,,,,,"<The integration of agile development and model driven development—a systematic literature review, {eid: 85041446030}>, <Lemesle, R.: SNets: The core formalism for an object-oriented CASE tool, {eid: 85137099027}>, <Grand challenges in model-driven engineering: an analysis of the state of the research, {eid: 85077634676, doi: 10.1007/s10270-019-00773-6}>, <DevOps from a sysadmin perspective, {eid: 85120298374}>, <None, {eid: 0006705483}>, <To build, or not to build: Modelflow, a build solution for MDE projects, {eid: 85096951447}>, <Challenges in model-driven software engineering, {eid: 67650110205}>, <None, {eid: 85137116237}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,2022-08-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85129817637

For instance, Twitter uses stream processing frameworks like Apache Storm to analyse billions of tweets per minute and learn the trending topics. However, architectures that process big data involve many different components interconnected via semantically different connectors. Such complex architectures make possible refactoring of the applications a difficult task for software architects, as applications might be very different with respect to the initial designs. As an aid to designers and developers, we developed OSTIA (Ordinary Static Topology Inference Analysis) that allows detecting the occurrence of common anti-patterns across big data architectures and exploiting software verification techniques on the elicited architectural models.

New software engineering challenges for BDA applications include ensuring performance levels of data-driven algorithms even in the presence of large data volume, velocity, and variety (3Vs). BDA software complexity frequently leads to delayed deployments, longer development cycles, and challenging performance assessment. This paper proposes a Domain-Specific Model (DSM), and DevOps practices to design, deploy, and monitor performance metrics in BDA applications. Our proposal includes a design process, and a framework to define architectural inputs, software components, and deployment strategies through integrated high-level abstractions to enable QS monitoring. We evaluate our approach with four use cases from different domains to demonstrate a high level of generalization. Our results show a shorter deployment and monitoring times, and a higher gain factor per iteration compared to similar approaches.","Big data analytics deployment, DevOps, Domain-specific model, Performance monitoring, Quality scenarios, Software architecture",,,,,,,,"<Quality-Aware Processing Pipeline Modeling: Tech.

Many software organizations are heading towards DevOps to leverage its benefits in terms of improved development speed, stability, collaboration, and communication. DevOps practices are essential to effectively implement in software organizations, but little attention has been given in the literature to how these practices can be managed. Our study aims to propose and develop a framework for effectively managing DevOps practices. We have conducted an empirical study using the publicly available HELENA2 dataset to identify the best practices for effectively implementing DevOps. Furthermore, we have used the prediction algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) to develop a prediction model for DevOps implementation. The findings of this study show that “Continuous deployment”, “Coding standards”, “Continuous integration”, and “Daily Standup” ""are the most significant practicesduring the life cycle of projects for effectively managing the DevOps practices. The contribution of this study is not only limited to investigating the best DevOps practices but also provides a prediction of DevOps project success and prioritization of best practices. It can assist software organizations in getting the best possible practices to focus on based on the nature of their projects.","Artificial neural network, DevOps, Prediction model, Random forest,

A key difference between the two lies in the strong dependency between the quality of a machine learning model and the quality of the data used to train or perform evaluations. In this work, we demonstrate how different aspects of data quality propagate through various stages of machine learning development. By performing a joint analysis of the impact of well-known data quality dimensions and the downstream machine learning process, we show that different components of a typical MLOps pipeline can be efficiently designed, providing both a technical and theoretical perspective.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,

It inaugurates the era of extreme ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (xURLLC) and pervades the digitalization of the various vertical immersive use cases. Since 6G inherently underpins artificial intelligence (AI), we propose a systematic and standalone slice termed SliceOps that is natively embedded in the 6G architecture, which gathers and manages the whole AI lifecycle through monitoring, re-training, and deploying the machine learning (ML) models as a service for the 6G slices. By leveraging machine learning operations (MLOps) in conjunction with eXplainable AI (XAI), SliceOps strives to cope with the opaqueness of black-box AI using explanation-guided reinforcement learning (XRL) to fulfill transparency, trustworthiness, and interpretability in the network slicing ecosystem. This article starts by elaborating on the architectural and algorithmic aspects of SliceOps. Then, the deployed cloud-native SliceOps working is exemplified via a latency-aware resource allocation problem. The deep RL (DRL)-based SliceOps agents within slices provide AI services aiming to allocate optimal radio resources and impede service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of SliceOps-driven slicing. The article discusses afterward the SliceOps challenges and limitations. Finally, the key open research directions corresponding to the proposed approach are identified.","6G, AI, MLOps, network slicing, resource allocation, XAI, XRL, zero-touch",,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,
44,,,,The systems engineering DevOps lemniscate and model-based system operations,2021,IEEE Systems Journal,,,,,,,0,10.1109/JSYST.2020.3015595,https://www.doi.org/10.1109/JSYST.2020.3015595,,,"Systems engineering is defined as a full life cycle discipline and provides methodologies and processes to support the design, development, verification, sustainment, and disposal of systems. While this cradle-to-grave concept is well documented throughout literature, there has been recent emphasis on evolving and digitally transforming systems engineering methodologies, practices, and tools for the latter phases of system life cycles. This article adapts principles from the software engineering domain DevOps concept (a collaborative merger of system development and operations) into a Systems Engineering DevOps (SEDevOps) life cycle model. This facilitates a merger of systems engineering processes, tools, and products into a surrogate operational environment in which the sustainment of a system is tied closely to the curation of a system model expanded to include the enabling system elements necessary for operations and sustainment (procedures, scripts, etc.). This progression of the systems engineering mindset, focused on digitally transforming and enhancing system operations and sustainment, improves agility in later life cycle phases. A framework for applying SEDevOps is introduced as a new systems modeling language profile. A use-case leveraging this model-based system operations framework, shows how merging support elements into a spacecraft system model improves adaptability during operations, exemplifying elements of a DevOps approach to cyber-physical system sustainment.","Agile, DevOps, digital transformation, life cycle, model-based systems engineering (MBSE), systems engineering",,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,
