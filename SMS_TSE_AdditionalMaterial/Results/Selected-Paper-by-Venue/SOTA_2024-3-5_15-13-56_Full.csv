Different technologies are used for communication between the massive connected devices through all layers of the IoT system, causing many security and performance issues. Regression and integration testing are considered repeatedly, in which the vast costs and efforts associated with the frequent execution of these inflated test suites hinder the adequate testing of such systems. This necessitates the focus on exploring innovative scalable testing approaches for large test suites in IoT-based systems. In this paper, a scalable framework for continuous integration and regression testing in IoT-based systems (IoT-CIRTF) is proposed, based on IoT-related criteria for test case prioritization and selection. The framework utilizes search-based techniques to provide an optimized prioritized set of test cases to select from. The selection is based on a trained prediction model for IoT standard components using supervised deep learning algorithms to continuously ensure the overall reliability of IoT-based systems. The experiments are held on two GSM datasets. The experimental results achieved prioritization accuracy up to 90% and 92% for regression testing and integration testing respectively. This provides an enhanced and efficient framework for continuous testing of IoT-based systems, as per IoT-related criteria for the prioritization and selection purposes.","Deep learning, integration

Regression testing is considered a good practice in software development with continuous integration, which ensures that code changes are not negatively affecting software functionality. As, nowadays, software development is carried out iteratively, with small code increments continuously developed and regression tested, it is of critical importance that continuous regression testing is time efficient. However, in practice, regression testing is often long lasting and faces scalability problems as software grows larger or as software changes are made more frequently. One contributing factor to these issues is test redundancy, which causes the same software functionality being tested multiple times across a test suite. In large-scale software, especially highly configurable software, redundancy in continuous regression testing can significantly grow the size of test suites and negatively affect the cost effectiveness of continuous integration. This paper presents a practical learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration testing by reducing ineffective test redundancy in regression suites. The novelty of the algorithm lies in learning and predicting the fault-detection effectiveness of continuous integration tests using historical test records and combining this information with coverage-based redundancy metrics. The goal is to identify ineffective redundancy, which is maximally reduced in the resulting regression test suite, thus reducing test time and improving the performance of continuous integration. We apply and evaluate the algorithm in two industrial projects of continuous integration. The results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the efficiency of continuous integration practice in terms of decreasing test execution time by 38% on average compared to the industry practice of our case study and by 40% on average compared to the retest-all approach. The results further demonstrate no significant reduction in fault-detection effectiveness of continuous regression testing. This suggests that the proposed algorithm contributes to the state of the practice in the continuous integration development and testing of highly configurable systems.","continuous integration, continuous integration testing, highly configurable software, highly interleaved test predictive algorithm, regression testing, regression trees, test optimization, test redundancy",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85026639599}>, <None, {eid: 84891715780}>, <None, {eid: 84935135489}>, <None, {eid: 84986877429}>, <None, {eid: 85049691252}>, <An AETG system: an approach to testing based on combinatorial design, {eid: 0000673732}>, <None, {eid: 0037587652}>, <None, {eid: 33847694980}>, <Test overlay in an emerging software product line - an industrial case study, {eid: 84872969667}>, <Learning from examples, generation and evaluation of decision trees for software resource analysis, {eid: 0024123707}>, <None, {eid: 0003512056}>, <Practical minimization of pairwise-covering test configurations using constraint programming, {eid: 84952845547}>, <Top 10 algorithms in data mining, {eid: 37549018049}>, <Predicting business failure using classification and regression tree: an empirical comparison with popular classical statistical methods and top classification mining methods, {eid: 77951206489}>, <None, {eid: 85060261902}>, <None, {eid: 67650148487}>, <None, {eid: 0036041041}>, <None, {eid: 85013123088}>, <None, {eid: 0003500248}>, <None, {eid: 85009962818}>, <None, {eid: 12844268515}>, <None, {eid: 1542347191}>, <None, {eid: 85060264405}>, <None, {eid: 33847304574}>, <None, {eid: 84944678252}>, <None, {eid: 84951764887}>, <Program slicing-based regression testing techniques, {eid: 0030173997}>, <A safe, efficient regression test selection technique, {eid: 0031125046}>, <Cost-effective regression testing through adaptive test prioritization strategies, {eid: 84960881560}>, <None, {eid: 84951766869}>, <None, {eid: 0036441907}>, <None, {eid: 84963549010}>, <None, {eid: 84964268054}>, <None, {eid: 85030784137}>, <None, {eid: 84997112179}>, <None, {eid: 85060264122}>, <None, {eid: 84856946297}>, <None, {eid: 85060263683}>, <None, {eid: 0032305987}>, <A tester-assisted methodology for test redundancy detection, {eid: 78149252006}>, <Redundancy based test-suite reduction, {eid: 37149024582}>, <A methodology for controlling the size of a test suite, {eid: 0027625420}>, <None, {eid: 33646942742}>, <Improving fault detection capability by selectively retaining test cases during test suite reduction, {eid: 33846855360}>, <An empirical study of test case filtering techniques based on exercising information flows, {eid: 34250772325}>, <None, {eid: 77949900972}>, <None, {eid: 84863156883}>, <None, {eid: 84903123998}>, <Empirical studies of test-suite reduction, {eid: 0036957531}>, <None, {eid: 15844394509}>",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,2019-02-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85056634616,True,False,False,False

Often a representation that reflects the internal structure of the managed system is used to reason about its characteristics and make the appropriate adaptation decisions. However, runtime conditions can radically change the internal structure in ways that were not accounted for during their design. As a result, unanticipated changes at runtime that violate the assumptions made about the internal structure of the system could degrade the accuracy of the adaptation decisions. We present an approach for engineering self-adaptive software systems that brings about two innovations: 1) a feature-oriented approach for representing engineers' knowledge of adaptation choices that are deemed practical, and 2) an online learning-based approach for assessing and reasoning about adaptation decisions that does not require an explicit representation of the internal structure of the managed software system. Engineers' knowledge, represented in feature-models, adds structure to learning, which in turn makes online learning feasible. We present an empirical evaluation of the framework using a real-world self-adaptive software system. Results demonstrate the framework's ability to accurately learn the changing dynamics of the system while achieving efficient analysis and adaptation. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","Autonomic computing,

CPSs are systems that integrate digital cyber computations with physical processes. The development of software for CPSs demands a constant maintenance to support new requirements, bug fixes, and deal with hardware obsolescence. The key in this process is code testing and more if the code is fragmented during the development of CPSs. It is important to remark that this process is challenging and time-consuming. In this paper, we report on the experience of instantiating of the microservice-based architecture for DevOps of CPSs to test elevator dispatching algorithms across different test levels (i.e., SiL, HiL and Operation). Such an architecture allows for a continuous deployment, monitoring and validation of CPSs. By integrating the approach with a real industrial case study, we demonstrate that our approach reduces significantly the time needed in the testing process and consequently, reduces the economic cost of the entire process.","Cyber-Physical Systems, Elevators, Testing",,,,,,,,"<Deis: Dependability engineering innovation for industrial cps, {eid: 85052091111}>, <Automatic generation of test system

Rapid evolution and continuous deployment represent specific benefits of microservice-based systems, but they may have a significant impact on non-functional properties like performance. Despite the obvious relevance of this property, there is still a lack of systematic approaches that explicitly take into account performance issues in the lifecycle of microservice-based systems. In such a context of evolution and re-deployment, Model-Driven Engineering techniques can provide major support to various software engineering activities, and in particular they can allow managing the relationships between a running system and its architectural model. In this paper, we propose a model-driven integrated approach that exploits traceability relationships between the monitored data of a microservice-based running system and its architectural model to derive recommended refactoring actions that lead to performance improvement. The approach has been applied and validated on two microservice-based systems, in the domain of e-commerce and ticket reservation, respectively, whose architectural models have been designed in UML profiled with MARTE.","Continuous deployment, Microservices, Model-driven engineering, Performance engineering, Software evolution, Software refactoring",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85117092929}>, <Performance-driven software model refactoring, {eid: 85029760730, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2017.09.006}>, <Exploiting architecture/runtime model-driven traceability for performance improvement, {eid: 85065793737, doi: 10.1109/ICSA.2019.00017}>, <Performance-based software model refactoring in fuzzy contexts, {eid: 84944250248, doi: 10.1007/978-3-662-46675-9_10}>, <Models@run.time: a guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, {eid: 85059780955, doi: 10.1007/s10270-018-00712-x}>, <Models@run.time, {eid: 85008066028, doi: 10.1109/MC.2009.326}>, <Model-driven engineering for design-runtime interaction in complex systems: Scientific challenges and roadmap -

Cloud-based DevOps processes facilitate the continuous delivery of infrastructure and software applications (i.e. cloud resources). In particular, Infrastructure as Code is the cornerstone of DevOps for automating the infrastructure provisioning based on practices from software development. There exist several Configuration Management Tools (CMTs) that use script languages to define the infrastructure provisioning to be deployed in a particular cloud provider. However, manual setting of the script languages to establish the infrastructure provisioning in a CMT for a particular cloud provider is a time-consuming and error-prone activity. For these reasons, the aim of my PhD research is proposing a model-driven approach to abstract and automate a continuous delivery process of cloud resources through model-driven techniques and DevOps. In addition, this approach seeks to cover the development process of cloud resources in development, testing and production environments.","Cloud computing, Cloud resources, Continuous delivery, DevOps, Infrastructure as code, Model-Driven development",,,,,,,,"<Modern DevOps: Optimizing software development through effective system interactions, {eid: 84940533528}>, <None, {eid: 84858197925}>, <None, {eid: 85026761147}>, <None, {eid: 84956782190}>, <Streamlining DevOps automation for Cloud applications using TOSCA as standardized metamodel, {eid: 84958740530}>, <MORE: A model-driven operation service for cloud-based IT systems.

Based on these specifications the complete CI/CD configurations are generated fully and automatically guaranteeing their correctness with regard to the specification by construction. This way typical sources of critical errors can be avoided lowering the hurdle to introduce CI/CD especially in mature projects.

When reliant on deep learning, these systems need to address the reliability, robustness, and interpretability of learning models. In addition to developing specific strategies to address each of these concerns, appropriate software architectures are needed to coordinate LECs and ensure they deliver acceptable behavior under uncertain conditions. This work proposes a model-driven framework of loosely-coupled modular services designed to monitor and control LECs with respect to Trusted AI assurance concerns. The proposed framework is composable, deploying independent services to improve the resilience and robustness of AI systems. The overarching objective of this framework is to support software engineering principles focusing on modularity, composability, and reusability in order to facilitate development and maintenance tasks, while also increasing stakeholder confidence in Trusted AI systems. To demonstrate this framework, it has been implemented to manage the operation of an autonomous rover's vision-based LEC while exposed to uncertain environmental conditions.","artificial intelligence, deep learning, models at run time, self-adaptive systems, software engineering",,,,,,,,"<Trustworthy AI, {eid: 85116000050}>, <None, {eid: 84944735469}>, <More Companies Flag a New Risk: Artificial Intelligence, {eid: 85142352957}>, <None, {eid: 85094908816}>, <None, {eid: 85142395476}>, <Trustworthy AI Is A Framework to Help Manage Unique Risk, {eid: 85088148273}>, <None, {eid: 85084062801}>, <The AI Effect: Working at the Intersection of AI and SE, {eid: 85087334830}>, <The Five Laws of SE for AI, {eid: 85077228353}>, <Adversarial Attacks and Defenses: An Interpretation Perspective, {eid: 85096642484}>, <From Monolith to Microservices: A Classification of Refactoring Approaches, {eid: 85095371364}>, <A Survey on Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning, {eid: 85068705129}>, <Towards Enterprise- Ready AI Deployments: Minimizing the Risk of Consuming AI Models in Business Applications, {eid: 85064231120}>, <None, {eid: 85010410859}>, <Microservices Architecture Enables DevOps: Migration to a Cloud-Native Architecture, {eid: 84968796741}>, <Migrating Monolithic Mobile Application to Microservice Architecture: An Experiment Report, {eid: 85032264331}>, <Towards AI-enabled Microservice Architecture for Network Function Virtualization, {eid: 85097599131}>, <Cloud-Edge Microservice Architecture for DNN-based Distributed Multimedia Event Processing, {eid: 85103490774}>, <AI Bricks: A Microservices-Based Software for a Usage in the Cloud Robotics, {eid: 85056756889}>, <A Survey of Uncertainty in Deep Neural Networks, {eid: 85117971804}>, <A Survey of Robust Adversarial Training in Pattern Recognition: Fundamental, Theory, and Methodologies, {eid: 85142395022}>, <The Vision of Autonomic Computing, {eid: 0037253062}>, <None, {eid: 85118707330}>, <From Object Orientation to Goal Orientation: A Paradigm Shift for Requirements Engineering, {eid: 35048819568}>, <""know What You Know"": Predicting Behavior for Learning-Enabled Systems When Facing Uncertainty, {eid: 85113514072}>, <Adversarial Attacks and Defences: A Survey, {eid: 85068957995}>, <MoDALAS: Model-Driven Assurance for Learning-Enabled Autonomous Systems, {eid: 85123430406}>, <Model Inference and Testing, {eid: 84875297940}>, <Enki: A Diversity-Driven Approach to Test and Train Robust Learning-Enabled Systems, {eid: 85136237849}>, <Intriguing Properties of Neural Networks, {eid: 84925331214}>, <Measuring the Tendency of CNNs to Learn Surface Statistical Regularities, {eid: 85055695282}>, <DeepGauge: Multi-Granularity Testing Criteria for Deep Learning Systems, {eid: 85056490436}>, <DeepTest: Automated Testing of Deep-Neural-Network-Driven Autonomous Cars, {eid: 85069772253}>, <DeepHunter: A Coverage-Guided Fuzz Testing Framework for Deep Neural Networks, {eid: 85070586358}>, <DeepRoad: GAN-Based Metamorphic Testing and Input Validation Framework for Autonomous Driving Systems, {eid: 85056509092}>, <TensorFuzz: Debugging Neural Networks with Coverage-Guided Fuzzing, {eid: 85073172223}>, <Robotics Middleware: A Comprehensive Literature Survey and Attribute-Based Bibliography, {eid: 84872295345}>, <ROS: An Open-Source Robot Operating System, {eid: 77957352104}>, <It Takes a Village to Build a Robot: An Empirical Study of the ROS Ecosystem, {eid: 85096725328}>, <Mining Guidelines for Architecting Robotics Software, {eid: 85105348947}>, <None, {eid: 77954708825}>, <Elicitation and Utilization of Application- Level Utility Functions, {eid: 70049105374}>, <A Learning Approach to Enhance Assurances for Real-Time Self-Adaptive Systems, {eid: 85051544613}>, <Architecture-Based Self- Adaptation in the Presence of Multiple Objectives, {eid: 50249148558}>, <None, {eid: 85091849067}>, <None, {eid: 85142388539}>, <Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection, {eid: 85041916350}>, <None, {eid: 85140413950}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-09-19,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85142380092,False,False,False,True

Simultaneously, software takes over more and more safety-critical tasks, requiring strict software development processes. Up to today, these processes suffer from extensive manual review work and written, static documentation in form of standards, checklists, and procedures. This paper presents a monolithic, process-oriented build tool for model-based development in MATLAB, Simulink, and Stateflow. Beyond classical build automation functionality, it supports and accelerates process workflows. The tool provides infrastructure to formalize and ship workflows, checklists, and standards, but also features to assess completeness, consistency, compliance, and cleanliness with respect to them. Additionally, it allows definition of dynamic, incrementally updated checklists, and composes traceability in parallel with the build. The efficacy and achievable process coverage is demonstrated in an example application.","Build Automation, Component-based Software Engineering, Continuous Integration, Model Scaffolding, Model Standards, Software Development Process, Workflow Management System",,,,,,,,"<Software traceability with topic modeling, {eid: 77954731555}>, <Software certification of airborne cyber-physical systems under DO-178C, {eid: 84978477265}>, <None, {eid: 85052020299}>, <Towards scalable verification of commercial avionics software, {eid: 78649991384}>, <What is the benefit of a model-based design of embedded software systems in the car industry?, {eid: 84944678193}>, <Automating code reviews with simulink code inspector, {eid: 84873348691}>, <Verification and validation according to IEC 61508: A workflow to facilitate the development of high-integrity applications, {eid: 77952934643}>, <The modelery: A collaborative web based repository, {eid: 84904888914}>, <Pragmatic strategies for adopting model-based design for embedded applications, {eid: 85072358036}>, <None, {eid: 85052025584}>, <None, {eid: 85052014805}>, <A model-driven safety certification method for process compliance, {eid: 84922646738}>, <Traceability fundamentals, {eid: 84871007294}>, <None, {eid: 85052017820}>, <None, {eid: 85052011723}>, <Hierarchical edge bundles: Visualization of adjacency relations in hierarchical data, {eid: 33845640864}>, <None, {eid: 85052023436}>, <None, {eid: 85052023147}>, <Continuous delivery: Reliable software releases through build, test, and deployment automation, {eid: 84858197925}>, <An integrated view on modeling with multi domain-specific languages, {eid: 74549195796}>, <Strategic traceability for safety-critical projects, {eid: 84897584515}>, <Team-based collaboration in model-based design, {eid: 84880644657}>, <Using model-based development as software low-level requirements to achieve airborne software certification, {eid: 84863897252}>, <None, {eid: 77949517037}>, <On the exploration of model-based support for DO-178C-compliant avionics software development and certification, {eid: 85009771923}>, <None, {eid: 84978505075}>, <Which factors influence practitioners’ usage of build automation tools?, {eid: 85027711579}>, <None, {eid: 85179213591}>, <None, {eid: 84910086230}>, <None, {eid: 84898078761}>, <None, {eid: 84886689856}>, <None, {eid: 85052012732}>, <Traceability in model-driven engineering: Efficient and scalable traceability maintenance, {eid: 84949179515}>, <Dynamic hierarchical mega models: Comprehensive traceability and its efficient maintenance, {eid: 77956266933}>, <None, {eid: 67650563536}>, <None, {eid: 85015179105}>, <None, {eid: 85052013936}>, <Using rules for traceability creation, {eid: 84949179365}>",,,SciTePress,,,2018-01-22,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85052019687,True,False,False,False

Some of these changes may accidentally cause regression issues to the newly released software version. To ensure the correctness of the newly released software, it is important to perform enough testing prior to code submission to avoid breaking builds. Regression testing is one of the important maintenance activities that can control the quality and reliability of modified software, but it can also be very expensive. Test case prioritization can reduce the costs of regression testing by reordering test cases to meet testing objectives better. To date, various test prioritization techniques have been developed, however, the majority of the proposed approaches utilize static or dynamic analyses to decide which test cases should be selected. These analyses often have significant cost overhead and are time consuming. This paper introduces a new method for automatic test case prioritization in a CI environment intending to minimize the testing cost. Our proposed approach uses information retrieval to automatically select test cases based on their textual similarity to the portion of the code that has been changed. Our technique not only helps developers to organize and manage the software repository but also helps them to find the relevant resources quickly. To evaluate our approach, we performed an empirical study using 37 versions of 6 open source applications. The results of our empirical study indicate that our proposed method can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of test case prioritization technique.","Continuous Integration, IR-based Regression

There are different models used in this particular phase including class diagrams, state diagrams and use cases etc. To test the conformance of the software it is very essential that test cases should be derived from these specific models. Similarly regressions testing through these models are very significant for testing of modified software. There are several regression testing approaches based on these model in literature. This survey report is the analysis of the model based regression testing techniques according to the parameter identified during this study. The summary as well as the analysis of the approaches is discussed in this survey report. In the end we concluded the survey by identifying the areas of further research in the field of model based regression testing.","Embedded testing, MDA, model based regression testing, Regression testing, Testing evaluation parameters, UML regression testing",,,,,,,,"<Borland, {eid: 82255169100}>, <None, {eid: 0037888603}>, <None, {eid: 0003704024}>, <None, {eid: 82255196754}>, <None, {eid: 82255169099}>, <Patton model based testing in pratice software engineering, {eid: 0032660359}>, <An overview of regression testing, {eid: 27944449669}>, <Insights into regression testing, {eid: 0024884273}>, <An approach for selective state machine based regression testing, {eid: 38849113163}>, <Generating regression tests via model checking, {eid: 18744364718}>, <Model-based regression test suite generation using dependence analysis, {eid: 38849154386}>, <Model based regression test reduction using dependence analysis, {eid: 0036441907}>, <Regression test suite reduction using extended dependence analysis, {eid: 41149088364}>, <Specification based regression test selection with risk analysis, {eid: 24944502842}>, <Automating impact analysis and regression test selection based on UML designs.

Continuous Integration Testing (CIT) is an effective technology to discover bugs as early as possible. However, the diversity of programming models used in an SOA solution and the distribution nature of an SOA solution pose new challenges for CIT. Existing testing frameworks more focus on the integration testing of applications developed by a single programming model. In this paper, a unified test framework is proposed to overcome these limitations and enable the CIT of SOA solutions across the whole development lifecycle. This framework is designed following the Model Driven Architecture (MDA). The information of an executable test case is separated into two layers: the behavior layer and the configuration layer. The behavior layer represents the test logic of a test case and is platform independent. The configuration layer contains the platform specific information and is configurable for different programming models. An extensible and pluggable test execution engine is specially designed to execute the integration test cases. A global test case identifier instrumentation approach is used to merge the distributed test case execution traces captured by ITCAM - an IBM integrated management tool. A verification approach supporting Boolean expression and back-end service interaction verification is proposed to verify the test execution result. Initial experiments have shown the effectiveness of this unified test framework. © 2009 IEEE.","Continuous integration testing, Service oriented architecture",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 0006705483}>, <Surrogate: A simulation apparatus for continuous integration testing in service oriented architecture, {eid: 51749120985}>, <SOMA-ME: A platform for the model-driven design of SOA solutions, {eid: 55449092351}>, <SeDiTeC - Testing based on sequence diagrams, {eid: 84982953299}>, <Tivoli.

This way we are able to closely monitor and steer the evolution of applications throughout their whole life-cycle with minimum manual effort. Key to this approach is to establish a stable level for comparison via an incrementally growing behavioral abstraction in terms of a user-centric communication alphabet: The letters of this alphabet, which may correspond to whole use cases, are intended to directly express the functionality from the user perspective. At the same time their choice allows one to focus on specific aspects, which establishes tailored abstraction levels on demand, which may be refined by adding new letters in the course of the systems evolution. This way ACQC does not only allow us to reveal serious bugs simply by inspecting difference views of the (tailored) models, but also to visually follow and control the effects of (intended) changes, which complements our model-checking-based quality control. All this will be illustrated along reallife scenarios that arose during the component-based development of a commercial editorial system.

This paper proposes a process, that is especially suitable for the development of new functions in higher programming languages and the usage of machine learning models. When developed in a tool like MATLAB, code generators can be used to integrate the function step-by-step into a service-oriented automotive E/E-architecture. It is based on a classic V-model process and uses integration steps according to the XiL approach. The key aspect is the frontloading of verification and validation into the steps as early as possible to keep iteration cycles fast. The proposed process is applied to the development of a Neural Network Model Predictive Control (NNMPC) for a Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) unit of a city bus. The resulting NNMPC is then integrated into a system based on the AUTOSAR adaptive platform. That allowed the function to be developed and integrated quickly and seems to be a promising approach to bring new functions into already existing automotive E/E-architectures.","automotive software, AUTOSAR Adaptive, service-oriented architecture, software development process",,,,,,,,"<Das V-Modell: der Standard für die Softwareentwicklung mit Praxisleitfaden, {eid: 0003635013}>, <Anwendungsorientierte Übersicht kommerzieller Fahrzeug-Simulations-Systeme, {eid: 85139126764}>, <Hardware-in-the-loop simulation for the design and testing of engine-control systems, {eid: 0032628973}>, <None, {eid: 85066461200}>, <None, {eid: 85118775919}>, <Progress on the AUTOSAR Adaptive Platform for Intelligent Vehicles, {eid: 85139132955}>, <An Overview of Automotive Service-Oriented Architectures and Implications for Security Countermeasures, {eid: 85147696411}>, <None, {eid: 70350685372}>, <None, {eid: 4644233230}>, <Model Predictive HVAC Control with disturbance variable forecasting for city buses, {eid: 85119400006}>, <None, {eid: 85111610627}>, <Future Automotive Architecture and the Impact of IT Trends, {eid: 85028048781}>, <None, {eid: 85139138777}>, <Model-Based Automotive Software Development, {eid: 85105764504}>, <None, {eid: 84892106390}>, <None, {eid: 77954399574}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2022-05-12,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85139087126,True,False,False,False

Model learning aims to construct behavioral models. Due to the commonalities among the products of an SPL, it is possible to reuse the previously-learned models during the model learning process. In this paper, an adaptive approach, called PL∗, for learning the product models of an SPL is presented based on the well-known L∗ algorithm. In this method, after learning each product, the sequences in the final observation table are stored in a repository which is used to initialize the observation table of the remaining products. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two open-source SPLs and the learning cost is measured in terms of the number of rounds, resets, and input symbols. The results show that for complex SPLs, the total learning cost of PL∗ is significantly lower than that of the non-adaptive method in terms of all three metrics. Furthermore, it is observed that the order of learning products affects the efficiency of PL∗. We introduce a heuristic to determine an ordering which reduces the total cost of adaptive learning.","adaptive model learning, automata learning, finite state machines, software product lines",,,,,,,,"<Reverse Engineering Feature Models from Software Configurations using Formal Concept Analysis, {eid: 84961377139}>, <Learning Regular Sets from Queries and Counterexamples, {eid: 0023453626}>, <A Development Process for Feature-Oriented Product Lines, {eid: 85045581970}>, <Automated analysis of feature models 20 years later: A literature review, {eid: 77955227439}>, <Verification of evolving software via component substitutability analysis, {eid: 44349129704}>, <A Greedy Heuristic for the Set-Covering Problem, {eid: 0000301097}>, <None, {eid: 77954732987}>, <None, {eid: 84864250191}>, <Software product lines-practices and patterns, {eid: 0004161809}>, <Learning from difference: An automated approach for learning family models from software product lines, {eid: 85123041275}>, <Learning to Reuse: Adaptive Model Learning for Evolving Systems, {eid: 85076982200}>, <Learning by sampling: Learning behavioral family models from software product lines, {eid: 85099082851}>, <LIFTS: Learning Featured Transition Systems, {eid: 85115186006}>, <Validated Test Models for Software Product Lines: Featured Finite State Machines, {eid: 85018251728}>, <Variability in Software Systems-A Systematic Literature Review, {eid: 84897604910}>, <None, {eid: 0003690974}>, <Adaptive Model Checking, {eid: 84888270231}>, <Inferring Finite State Machines Without Reset Using State Identification Sequences, {eid: 84952837398}>, <Inferring FSM Models of Systems Without Reset, {eid: 85051141395}>, <Reverse Engineering Feature Models from Programs Feature Sets, {eid: 83455213219}>, <Adaptive Learning for Learn-Based Regression Testing, {eid: 85053602861}>, <Matplotlib: A 2D graphics environment, {eid: 34247493236}>, <Model Inference and Testing, {eid: 84875297940}>, <Properties of Realistic Feature Models Make Combinatorial Testing of Product Lines Feasible, {eid: 80054081086}>, <None, {eid: 23744500479}>, <None, {eid: 0003512056}>, <The SAT4J library, Release 2. 2.

Learn-based testing can be used to automatically check new versions of a system for regressions on a system level. This is done by learning a model of the system and model checking this model for system property violations. Learning the model of a large system can take an unpractical amount of time however. In this work we investigate if the concept of adaptive learning can improve the learning speed of a model in a regression testing scenario.

It has been demonstrated that historical information-based reward function can improve the effectiveness of the test case prioritization (TCP). However, the inherent character of frequent iterations in CI can produce a considerable accumulation of historical information, which may decrease TCP efficiency and result in slow feedback. In this paper, the partial historical information is considered in the reward computation, where sliding window techniques are adopted to capture the possible efficient information. Firstly, the fixed-size sliding window is introduced to set a fixed length of recent historical information for each CI test. Then dynamic sliding window techniques are proposed, where the window size is continuously adaptive to each CI testing. Two methods are proposed, the test suite-based dynamic sliding window and the individual test case-based dynamic sliding window. The empirical studies are conducted on fourteen industrial-level programs, and the results reveal that under limited time, the sliding window-based reward function can effectively improve the TCP effect, where the NAPFD (Normalized Average Percentage of Faults Detected) and Recall of the dynamic sliding windows are better than that of the fixed-size sliding window. In particular, the individual test case-based dynamic sliding window approach can rank 74.18% failed test cases in the top 50% of the sorting sequence, with 1.35% improvement of NAPFD and 6.66 positions increased in TTF (Test to Fail).","Continuous integration, reinforcement learning, reward computation, sliding window, test case prioritization",,,,,,,,"<Continuous integration, delivery and deployment: A systematic review on approaches, tools, challenges and practices, {eid: 85019140530}>, <Continuous integration and its tools, {eid: 84899646622}>, <Test case prioritization in continuous integration environments: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85078708254}>, <Effect of time window on the performance of continuous regression testing, {eid: 85013123088}>, <Comparing white-box and black-box test prioritization, {eid: 84971425590}>, <Test re-prioritization in continuous testing environments, {eid: 85058303599}>, <Reinforcement learning: An introduction, {eid: 85067344495}>, <Reinforcement learning for automatic test case prioritization and selection in continuous integration, {eid: 85026639599}>, <Learning-to-rank vs ranking-to-learn: Strategies for regression testing in continuous integration, {eid: 85094318353}>, <Reward, motivation, and reinforcement learning, {eid: 0037057808}>, <A systematic study of reward for reinforcement learning based continuous integration testing, {eid: 85089907018}>, <Reward of reinforcement learning of test optimization for continuous integration, {eid: 85071576780}>, <History-based test case prioritization with software version awareness, {eid: 84885230977}>, <Test case prioritization approaches in regression testing: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85028775957}>, <Failure history data-based test case prioritization for effective regression test, {eid: 85020852947}>, <A time window based reinforcement learning reward for test case prioritization in continuous integration, {eid: 85092308710}>, <A study of effective regression testing in practice, {eid: 0031335528}>, <Prioritizing test cases for regression testing, {eid: 0035481183}>, <A survey on regression test-case prioritization, {eid: 85058421655}>, <Relationbased test case prioritization for regression testing, {eid: 85079013222}>, <Version specific test case prioritization approach based on artificial neural network, {eid: 85067622737}>, <Incorporating fault-proneness estimations into coverage-based test case prioritization methods, {eid: 85079054649}>, <Requirements based test prioritization using risk factors, {eid: 84946595421}>, <History-based test case prioritization for failure information, {eid: 85018510656}>, <Search algorithms for regression test case prioritization, {eid: 34047189734}>, <A fine-grained parallel multiobjective test case prioritization on GPU, {eid: 84884966832}>, <None, {eid: 84951288122}>, <Epistasis based ACO for regression test case prioritization, {eid: 85039920863}>, <An empirical study of regression testing techniques incorporating context and lifetime factors and improved costbene fit models, {eid: 34547306676}>, <Selecting a cost-effective test case prioritization technique, {eid: 3142772245}>, <The impact of continuous integration on other software development practices: A large-scale empirical study, {eid: 85041445161}>, <How does regression test prioritization perform in real-world software evolution?, {eid: 84971393429}>, <Prioritizing JUnit test cases in absence of coverage information, {eid: 70849096646}>, <Techniques for improving regression testing in continuous integration development environments, {eid: 84986877429}>, <Test case prioritization for continuous regression testing: An industrial case study, {eid: 84891715780}>, <Enhanced weighted method for test case prioritization in regression testing using unique priority value, {eid: 85018268821}>, <Experience report: Automated system level regression test prioritization using multiple factors, {eid: 85013287871}>, <Test prioritization in continuous integration environments, {eid: 85053760573}>, <None, {eid: 85102302639}>, <None, {eid: 85102288696}>, <None, {eid: 85102275463}>, <None, {eid: 85010746053}>, <Reinforcement learning and the reward engineering principle, {eid: 85048232151}>, <Combinatorial interaction regression testing: A study of test case generation and prioritization, {eid: 47349111813}>, <Prioritizing test cases for regression testing, {eid: 0035481183}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85102280980,False,False,False,True

In this work we present four complementary approaches to allow extensions for GUIs that we encounter with the generator-based framework MontiGem to tackle these challenges. We discuss the four approaches in detail and present extensions of the framework in the grammar of the language, via atomic components, via hand-written amendments of generated models and by generating connections between the GUI and data structure models.

As an example, the design quality of the source code will likely be more important if the associated feature is frequently used by customers or if it has strategic value for the software manufacturer. In order to effectively approach these qualitative subtleties, we need a means to specify non-functional requirements on the level of individual software features. Fine-grained specification of non-functional requirements on feature level respects their individual relevance for a feature and facilitates deriving suitable constraints for them. Particularly in DevOps-driven software projects with operational data the fulfillment of non-functional requirements for individual features can then continuously be evaluated. This guides software engineers in meeting these quality expectations on a much finer level than if treated uniformly across the software system. In this paper we present an extension of the QUAMOCO meta quality model for specifying and evaluating non-functional requirements on feature level. While the existing meta model focused on static quality measures, the extension of the meta model now also captures dynamic measures which accumulate during feature execution. An exploratory case study based on the results from an interview study shows the completeness of the approach for specifying and evaluating feature-dependent non-functional requirements.","Constraint Specification, Non-Functional Requirements, Operational Software Quality, Quality Modeling",,,,,,,,"<Feature-Oriented Software Development, {eid: 84894201602}>, <Operationalised product quality models and assessment: The Quamoco approach, {eid: 84932604209}>, <Beyond continuous delivery: An empirical investigation of continuous deployment challenges, {eid: 85042364114}>, <A Systematic Mapping Study of Quality Assessment Models for Software Products, {eid: 85043486651}>, <The Quamoco Tool Chain for Quality Modeling and Assessment, {eid: 79959873636}>, <A Quality Model for Actionable Analytics in Rapid Software Development, {eid: 85055775949}>, <Are Comprehensive Quality Models Necessary for Evaluating Software Quality, {eid: 84929616696}>, <Evaluating different i∗-based approaches for selecting functional requirements while balancing and optimizing non-functional requirements: A controlled experiment, {eid: 85054055964}>, <Dealing with Non-Functional Requirements in Model-Driven Development, {eid: 78650345309}>, <Modeling and verification of Functional and Non-Functional Requirements of ambient Self-Adaptive Systems, {eid: 84937425621}>, <Goal-directed requirements acquisition, {eid: 0027574423}>, <Adaptive monitoring of software requirements, {eid: 78650346140}>, <Supporting Self-Adaptation via Quantitative Verification and Sensitivity Analysis at Run Time, {eid: 84962298846}>, <Dealing with Non-Functional Requirements for Adaptive Systems via Dynamic Software Product-Lines, {eid: 84883565751}>, <Towards a Monitoring Middleware for Cloud Services, {eid: 84953392422}>, <Comprehensive Explanation of SLA Violations at Runtime, {eid: 84903125151}>, <A Research Preview on TAICOS-Tailoring Stakeholder Interests to Task-Oriented Functional Requirements, {eid: 85080511289}>, <Towards Continuous Quality: Measuring and Evaluating Feature-Dependent Non-Functional Requirements in DevOps, {eid: 85066466176}>, <Towards Automated Data Integration in Software Analytics, {eid: 85080590973}>, <Muse: A framework for measuring object-oriented design quality, {eid: 84990913604}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-08-28,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85076012146,False,True,True,False

Moreover, rare are the DL approaches addressing specifically requirements engineering. In this paper, we define a model-driven engineering (MDE) method based on traditional requirements engineering to improve datasets requirements engineering. Our MDE method is composed of a process supported by tools to aid customers and analysts in eliciting, specifying and validating dataset structural requirements for DL-based systems. Our model driven engineering approach uses the UML semi-formal modeling language for the analysis of datasets structural requirements, and the Alloy formal language for the requirements model execution based on our informal translational semantics. The model executions results are then presented to the customer for improving the dataset validation activity. Our approach aims at validating DL-based dataset structural requirements by modeling and instantiating their datatypes. We illustrate our approach with a case study on the requirements engineering of the structure of a dataset for classification of five-segments digits images.","Alloy, EMF, Model-driven Engineering, Requirements Engineering, Sirius, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,"<Software Engineering for Machine Learning: A Case Study, {eid: 85072111655}>, <Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with Xtext and Xtend: Learn How to Implement a DSL with Xtext and Xtend Using Easy-to-Understand Examples and Best Practices, {eid: 84906918277}>, <Preface to MDE Intelligence: 1st Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Model-Driven Engineering, {eid: 85075941198}>, <None, {eid: 85173960172}>, <Scenic: A Language for Scenario Specification and Scene Generation, {eid: 85067686177}>, <None, {eid: 85173973444}>, <Trials and tribulations of developers of intelligent systems: A field study, {eid: 85000434626}>, <None, {eid: 33748952774}>, <Software Engineering for Dataset Augmentation using Generative Adversarial Networks, {eid: 85082854426}>, <Specifying Key- Properties to Improve the Recognition Skills of Neural Networks, {eid: 85103020670}>, <Software Engineering for Machine- Learning Applications: The Road Ahead, {eid: 85054380679}>, <None, {eid: 85103027595}>, <None, {eid: 0042297467}>, <None, {eid: 84878696848}>, <None, {eid: 77957994724}>, <None, {eid: 85055572256}>, <None, {eid: 85068600733}>, <DeepXplore: Automated Whitebox Testing of Deep Learning Systems, {eid: 85041685057}>, <None, {eid: 84864328836}>, <None, {eid: 85103013243, doi: 10.5281/zenodo.4020938}>, <From UML to Alloy and back again, {eid: 78650498522}>, <None, {eid: 0003885423}>, <None, {eid: 14944348412}>, <None, {eid: 85090115678}>, <None, {eid: 85048866905}>, <Kodkod: A Relational Model Finder, {eid: 37149013755}>, <Sirius: A rapid development of DSM graphical editor, {eid: 84908620372}>, <None, {eid: 85078017230}>, <None, {eid: 84964923424}>",,,"Science and Technology Publications, Lda",,,2021-02-08,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85173980697,True,True,True,True

This paper presents AppFlow, a system for synthesizing highly robust, highly reusable UI tests. It leverages machine learning to automatically recognize common screens and widgets, relieving developers from writing ad hoc, fragile logic to use them in tests. It enables developers to write a library of modular tests for the main functionality of an app category (e.g., an ""add to cart"" test for shopping apps). It can then quickly test a new app in the same category by synthesizing full tests from the modular ones in the library. By focusing on the main functionality, AppFlow provides ""smoke testing"" requiring little manual work. Optionally, developers can customize AppFlow by adding app-specific tests for completeness. We evaluated AppFlow on 60 popular apps in the shopping and the news category, two case studies on the BBC news app and the JackThreads shopping app, and a user-study of 15 subjects on the Wish shopping app. Results show that AppFlow accurately recognizes screens and widgets, synthesizes highly robust and reusable tests, covers 46.6% of all automatable tests for Jackthreads with the tests it synthesizes, and reduces the effort to test a new app by up to 90%. Interestingly, it found eight bugs in the evaluated apps, including seven functionality bugs, despite that they were publicly released and supposedly went through thorough testing.","machine learning,

Knowledge about software architecture is key for both, developers while evolving the system and operators while adapting the system. Existing architectural models used in development differ from those used in operation in terms of purpose, abstraction and content. Consequences are limited reuse of development models during operation, lost architectural knowledge and limited phase-spanning consideration of software architecture. In this paper, we propose modeling concepts of the iObserve approach to align architectural models used in development and operation. We present a correspondence model to bridge the divergent levels of abstraction between implementation artifacts and component-based architectural models. A transformation pipeline uses the information stored in the correspondence model to update architectural models based on changes during operation. Moreover, we discuss the modeling of complex workload based on observations during operation. In a case study-based evaluation, we examine the accuracy of our models to reflect observations during operation and the scalability of the transformation pipeline. Evaluation results show the accuracy of iObserve. Furthermore, evaluation results indicate iObserve adequately scales for some cases but shows scalability limits for others.","Palladio Component Model, Performance model, Runtime model, Software

This process is known as architecture erosion. In this article, we propose an approach for recovering the implemented architecture, and detecting violations when comparing it with the intended architecture. Given a code repository, the continuous integration pipeline calls the solution to detect the incidences of architecture violations as well as some quality and social metrics. This data is presented in metric-centered views that help development teams to manage architecture erosion. Our approach is based on model-driven engineering techniques since models serve to represent the code, and a model-based pattern language helps us to automate the search for violation occurrences and execute corresponding actions (e.g., creation/assignment of issues). We confirm the approach benefits in a real project implemented by a software developing company, in a sample project available on the internet, and in a software development course, including 20 projects, where every single project decreases its architecture violations density through time.","architecture discovering, architecture recovering, conformance checking, continuous integration",,,,,,,,"<Decision making in software architecture, {eid: 84956623197}>, <Technical debt and system architecture: the impact of coupling on defect-related activity, {eid: 85027922641}>, <Towards a reference process for software architecture reconstruction, {eid: 85097339934}>, <Controlling software architecture erosion: a survey, {eid: 80755136651}>, <Software architecture erosion: impacts, causes, and management, {eid: 85107011113}>, <Software architecture degradation in open source software: a systematic literature review, {eid: 85101866665}>, <Recovering architectural assumptions, {eid: 33645145073}>, <Documenting after the fact: recovering architectural design decisions, {eid: 40049088606}>, <None, {eid: 77955136099}>, <None, {eid: 84951865531}>, <None, {eid: 85049697376}>, <None, {eid: 84855434526}>, <Detecting, tracing, and monitoring architectural tactics in code, {eid: 84963878679}>, <None, {eid: 84963491024}>, <None, {eid: 85119561514}>, <None, {eid: 85044185772}>, <None, {eid: 85051569623}>, <None, {eid: 85107002894}>, <None, {eid: 85075921993}>, <A collaborative framework to minimise knowledge loss in new product development, {eid: 84873437909}>, <None, {eid: 78649777834}>, <None, {eid: 85102555475}>, <None, {eid: 84964607566}>, <None, {eid: 84879856670}>",,,John Wiley and Sons Ltd,,,2021-08-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85106982705,True,False,True,False

While the research of machine learning algorithms is very active and continues to reveal astonishing possibilities on a regular basis, the wide usage of these algorithms is shifting the research focus to the integration, maintenance, and evolution of AI-driven systems. Although there is a variety of machine learning frameworks on the market, there is little support for process automation and DevOps in machine learning-driven projects. In this paper, we discuss how metamodels can support the development of deep learning frameworks and help deal with the steadily increasing variety of learning algorithms. In particular, we present a deep learning-oriented artifact model which serves as a foundation for build automation and data management in iterative, machine learning-driven development processes. Furthermore, we show how schema and reference models can be used to structure and maintain a versatile deep learning framework. Feasibility is demonstrated on several state-of-the-art examples from the domains of image and natural language processing as well as decision making and autonomous driving.","artifact models, artificial intelligence, build systems, compiler, machine learning, metamodeling, reference models, training",,,,,,,,"<Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning, {eid: 85075670920}>, <Personalized and Automatic Model Repairing using Reinforcement Learning, {eid: 85075917035}>, <Improving Model Repair through Experience Sharing, {eid: 85089499795}>, <Towards an Artifact Model for Requirements to IT-enabled Product Service Systems, {eid: 84879972264}>, <On the Need for Megamodels, {eid: 84911928640}>, <None, {eid: 85090303288}>, <A logical approach to systems engineering artifacts: semantic relationships and dependencies beyond traceability-from requirements to functional and architectural views, {eid: 85029497266, doi: 10.1007/s10270-017-0619-4}>, <On the Need for Artifact Models in Model-Driven Systems Engineering Projects, {eid: 85042655599}>, <None, {eid: 85073625968}>, <DeepDriving: Learning affordance for direct perception in autonomous driving, {eid: 84973888858}>, <None, {eid: 85057019815}>, <Artefact-based requirements engineering: the AMDiRE approach, {eid: 84941994467}>, <Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, {eid: 0346608138}>, <Modeling Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Architectures for Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85075937600}>, <None, {eid: 85120869042}>, <None, {eid: 85147701586}>, <None, {eid: 85042276044}>, <The next evolution of MDE: a seamless integration of machine learning into domain modeling, {eid: 85019693871}>, <On the Unification of Megamodels, {eid: 85040140135}>, <The rationale of powertype-based metamodelling to underpin software development methodologies, {eid: 84863662948}>, <None, {eid: 85108965376}>, <Context-oriented programming, {eid: 43049088796}>, <None, {eid: 85116545679}>, <None, {eid: 84941620184}>, <MontiThings: Model-driven Development and Deployment of Reliable IoT Applications, {eid: 85116410296, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2021.111087}>, <A metamodel family for role-based modeling and programming languages, {eid: 84921724705}>, <None, {eid: 85057255740}>, <Modeling and Training of Neural Processing Systems, {eid: 85075936455}>, <On the Engineering of AI-Powered Systems, {eid: 85079270211}>, <Modeling Architectures of Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85025124378}>, <Highly-Optimizing and Multi-Target Compiler for Embedded System Models: C++ Compiler Toolchain for the Component and Connector Language EmbeddedMontiArc, {eid: 85056871758}>, <DIRE: A Neural Approach to Decompiled Identifier Naming, {eid: 85078913653}>, <Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition, {eid: 0032203257}>, <MNIST handwritten digit database, {eid: 2442474173}>, <None, {eid: 84965135289}>, <None, {eid: 84987947153}>, <Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning, {eid: 84924051598}>, <Automated Classification of Metamodel Repositories: A Machine Learning Approach, {eid: 85076112592, doi: 10.1109/MODELS.2019.00011}>, <Convolutional neural networks for enhanced classification mechanisms of metamodels, {eid: 85096121119}>, <ROS: an open-source Robot Operating System, {eid: 77957352104}>, <Validating UML models and OCL constraints, {eid: 84957023982}>, <Hidden technical debt in machine learning systems, {eid: 84965107309}>, <Recursive deep models for semantic compositionality over a sentiment treebank, {eid: 84926358845}>, <On the representation of roles in objectoriented and conceptual modelling, {eid: 0034301679}>, <None, {eid: 85038368581}>, <Multi-Modal Attention Network Learning for Semantic Source Code Retrieval, {eid: 85074667252, doi: 10.1109/ASE.2019.00012}>, <TORCS, the open racing car simulator, {eid: 76249122848}>, <Accelerating the Machine Learning Lifecycle with MLflow, {eid: 85072938346}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2021-10-17,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85120851738,False,True,True,True

All rights reserved.Due to the increasing amount of features, software developer within the automotive domain are confronted with steadily increasing complexity of models within their respective model-based development tools. This also impacts the cost and time needed to perform manual maintenance and quality control during the evolution of model-based software, delaying the detection and correction of quality defects. To prevent quality defects to pervade a model, quality assessment should continuously be performed, to provide rapid feedback to the developers. This paper introduces a framework to enable integrated quality assessment during the evolution of model-based software artifacts. The framework includes a model repository supporting the import of data-flow diagrams from The Mathwork's Matlab-Simulink/Stateflow, formal modules from IBM Rational DOORS and variability documentations from pure:systems pure:variants, as well as the synchronization of imported models with their initial sources. Analyses provided by the framework range from structural and semantical checks of MATLAB/Simulink models to consistency and user-defined conformity checks across all supported artifact types. Results computed by the framework are stored alongside the revisions of the artifacts they refer to.","Artifact integration, Model-based development, Quality assessment",,,,,,,,"<Models are code too: Near-miss clone detection for simulink models, {eid: 84873107888}>, <Seamless model-based development: From isolated tools to integrated model engineering environments, {eid: 77950458920}>, <None, {eid: 84905563698}>, <None, {eid: 85089593828}>, <Static value range analysis for matlab/simulink-models, {eid: 84990044733}>, <Code clone detection in practice, {eid: 77954702935}>, <Automatic evaluation of modelling rules and design guidelines, {eid: 84873932194}>, <Issues in clone classification for dataflow languages, {eid: 77954705103}>, <Detection and handling of model smells for matlab/simulink models, {eid: 84990067079}>, <Incremental integration of heterogeneous systems views, {eid: 34748818690}>, <None, {eid: 84955316092}>, <Duplicate detection and refactoring of matlab/simulink models, {eid: 84983369336}>, <Model-driven tool integration with modelbus, {eid: 74549141750}>, <None, {eid: 0003589319}>, <None, {eid: 84873502254}>, <None, {eid: 85089604892}>, <Model-based analysis of design artefacts applying an annotation concept, {eid: 85135931496}>, <None, {eid: 85089574469}>, <Software engineering and formal methods: 12th international conference, sefm 2014, grenoble, France, september 1-5 2014, {eid: 85089593394}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <Das mate projekt-visuelle spezifikation von matlab simulink/stateflow analysen und transformationen, {eid: 84873926944}>, <None, {eid: 85089569822}>, <Presentation of emf compare utility, {eid: 47749101164}>, <Gspan: Graph-based substructure pattern mining, {eid: 78149333073}>",,,fortiss GmbH,,,2016-03-30,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-84996742929,False,True,True,False

Software development therefore is critical to the success of the manufacturer to develop state of the art technology. Standards like ISO 26262 recommend requirement-based verification and test cases that are derived from requirements analysis. Agile development uses continuous integration tests which rely on test automation and evaluation. All these drove the development of a new model-based software verification environment. Various aspects had to be taken into account: the test case specification needs to be easily comprehensible and flexible in order to allow testing of different functional variants. The test environment should support different use cases like open-loop or closed-loop testing and has to provide corresponding evaluation methods for continuously changing as well as for discrete signals. In a joint project of RWTH Aachen University and Ford, a new tool, Arttest, has been developed for testing model-based software. The tool uses a domain specific language to specify the tests. It offers different test evaluation methods for automated open- and closed-loop testing and reactive testing. It automatically executes the tests, evaluates the outputs and generates summary reports indicating passed tests and errors found. The paper presents the tool and its various unique propositions such as domain specific test language, the evaluation properties and other features like open-loop and closed-loop capabilities.",,,,,,,,,"<Economical impact of model-based development of embedded software systems in cars, {eid: 79960107950, doi: 10.1365/s35595-011-0026-3}>, <Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Technology, {eid: 85018402638}>, <None, {eid: 0004217479}>, <None, {eid: 85018446942}>, <IEEE standard for floating-point arithmetic, {eid: 69149088136}>, <WCOMP: Waveform Comparison Tool for Mixed-signal Validation Regression in Memory Design, {eid: 46649090540}>",,,SAE International,,,2017-04-04,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85018395241,False,False,False,False

However, spreadsheet-based solutions are hard to maintain, reuse, integrate, and scale. This paper describes an approach for supporting 'DevOps for business users' that enables business-level users to manage the full lifecycle of a large class of cloud-hosted business processes. The approach builds on DevOps for software engineering, but removes software engineers from the loop. Unlike general-purpose 'low code' business process management systems, the approach incorporates aspects of a processing domain (e.g., billing) to create a DevOps experience that business users can master easily. In the approach, business users follow an agile 'specify-check-generate-deploy' methodology, enabling them to rapidly and iteratively generate and operationalize cloud-hosted processing systems, with little or no assistance from IT staff. We demonstrate and evaluate the approach using a system built for the billing application area, developed at IBM, which provides technology support and maintenance services for numerous clients, each with different billing needs and logic.

Automated testing of such model-driven applications gains growing relevance, and it becomes a key enabler if we want to found their development on continuous integration (CI) techniques.While process analysts are typically responsible for test case specifications from a business perspective, technically skilled process engineers take the responsibility for implementing the required test code. This is time-consuming and, due to their often different skills and backgrounds, might result in communication problems such as information losses and misunderstandings. This paper presents a new approach which enables an analyst to generate executable tests for PDAs without the need for manual coding. It consists of a sophisticated model analysis, a wizard-based specification of test cases, and a subsequent code generation. The resulting tests can easily be integrated into CI pipelines.The concept is underpinned by a user-friendly tool which has been evaluated in case studies and in real-world implementation projects from different industry sectors. During the evaluation, the prototype proved a more efficient test creation process and a higher test quality.","BPMN, Model-Based Testing, No-Code, Process-Driven Application",,,,,,,,"<Techniques for improving regression testing in continuous integration development environments, {eid: 84986877429}>, <End-to-end automatic business process validation, {eid: 85051251425}>, <None, {eid: 84930828704}>, <Benefits and limitations of automated software testing: Systematic literature review and practitioner survey, {eid: 84864258235}>, <None, {eid: 84904733980}>, <A regression testing approach for software product lines architectures, {eid: 79952086195}>, <Opportunities and constraints: The current struggle with bpmn, {eid: 73149121321}>, <None, {eid: 85065642773}>, <None, {eid: 85123616276}>, <Static analysis of bpmn-based process-driven applications, {eid: 85065655546}>, <None, {eid: 85091273861}>, <None, {eid: 85123619256}>, <None, {eid: 85104947067}>, <None, {eid: 84878217700}>, <Design science research evaluation, {eid: 84861217148}>, <Test case generation from bpmn models for automated testing of webbased bpm applications, {eid: 85041234887}>, <Design of a tool for generating test cases from bpmn, {eid: 84946687742}>, <Automatic test cases generation from business process models, {eid: 85049939808}>, <Semi-automatic test case generation from business process models, {eid: 84881567616}>, <Test case generation from bpmn with dmn, {eid: 85079842074}>, <Automated regression testing of bpmn 2.0 processes: A capture and replay framework for continuous delivery, {eid: 85084190357}>, <A tool for generating test case from bpmn diagram with a bpel diagram, {eid: 84978766788}>, <Uncovering data-flow anomalies in bpmn-based process-driven applications, {eid: 85104949600}>, <Xcfg based data flow analysis of business processes, {eid: 85066637564}>, <Structuring acyclic process models, {eid: 78049287225}>, <None, {eid: 85123595411}>, <None, {eid: 85123616657}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-10-25,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85123603523,True,True,True,False

A big and important challenge is to profile nontrivial web applications with large numbers of combinations of their input parameter values. Identifying and understanding particular subsets of inputs leading to performance bottlenecks is mostly manual, intellectually intensive and laborious procedure. We propose a novel approach for automating performance bottleneck detection using search-based input-sensitive application profiling. Our key idea is to use a genetic algorithm as a search heuristic for obtaining combinations of input parameter values that maximizes a fitness function that represents the elapsed execution time of the application. We implemented our approach, coined as Genetic Algorithm-driven Profiler (GA-Prof) that combines a search-based heuristic with contrast data mining of execution traces to accurately determine performance bottlenecks. We evaluated GA-Prof to determine how effectively and efficiently it can detect injected performance bottlenecks into three popular open source web applications. Our results demonstrate that GA-Prof efficiently explores a large space of input value combinations while automatically and accurately detecting performance bottlenecks, thus suggesting that it is effective for automatic profiling.","Application profiling, Performance bottlenecks",,,,,,,,"<On the application of genetic programming for software engineering predictive modeling: A systematic

The high availability and agility of the cloud demands organizations to migrate or design microservices, promoting the building of applications as a suite of small and cohesive services that are independently developed, deployed and scaled. Current cloud development approaches do not support the incremental integration needed for microservice platforms, and the agility of getting new functionalities out to customers is consequently affected by the lack of support for the integration design and automation of the development and deployment tasks. This paper presents an approach for the incremental integration of microservices that will allow architects to specify and design microservice integration, and provide mechanisms to automatically obtain the implementation code for business logic and interoperation among microservices, along with deployment and architectural reconfiguration scripts specific to the cloud environment in which the microservice will be deployed.","Cloud, Cloud architectures, Incremental, Integration, Microservices architectures",,,,,,,,"<Development and deployment at facebook, {eid: 84880146979}>, <Microservices, IoT, and Azure: Leveraging DevOps and Microservice Architecture to Deliver SaaS Solutions, {eid: 85046792617}>, <None, {eid: 84992401957}>, <None, {eid: 84950338538}>, <Service functional test automation, {eid: 84995934968}>, <None, {eid: 84995906617}>, <Controlling data in the cloud: Outsourcing computation without outsourcing control, {eid: 74049093526}>, <Designing a smart city internet of things platform with microservice architecture, {eid: 84959050879}>, <None, {eid: 85018761953}>, <The cloudMIG approach: Model-based migration of software systems to cloud-optimized applications, {eid: 84886445739}>, <Developing migratable multicloud applications based on MDE and adaptation techniques, {eid: 84884637858}>, <MODAC LOUDS: A model-driven approach for the design and execution of applications on multiple clouds, {eid: 84864997201}>, <An incremental and model driven approach for the dynamic reconfiguration of cloud application architectures, {eid: 84992731072}>, <Towards a model-driven dynamic architecture reconfiguration process for cloud services integration, {eid: 84923259718}>, <The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices, {eid: 85018783151}>, <Framework for platform agnostic enterprise application development supporting multiple clouds, {eid: 84937500863}>, <UML-based cloud application modeling with libraries, profiles, and templates, {eid: 84911965669}>, <A UML Profile for modeling multicloud applications, {eid: 84885733995}>, <Towards CloudML, a model-based approach to provision resources in the clouds, {eid: 84879762752}>, <SeaClouds: A European project on seamless management of multi-cloud applications, {eid: 84920511449}>, <Architecture description language for incremental integration of cloud services architectures, {eid: 85010452220}>, <None, {eid: 84867643299}>, <Evaluating REST architectures-approach, tooling and guidelines, {eid: 84951064164}>, <Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation, {eid: 84903601568}>, <None, {eid: 84950310360}>",,,Springer Heidelberg,,,2017-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85018772815,False,False,False,False

Electrification, autonomous driving, and connected cars are some of the driving needs in this changing world. Increasingly, vehicles are becoming software-intensive complex systems and most of the innovation within the automotive industry is based on electronics and software. Modern vehicles can have over 100 Electronic Control Units (ECUs), which are small computers, together executing gigabytes of software. ECUs are connected to each other through several networks within the car, and the car is increasingly connected with the outside world. These novelties ask for a change on how the software is engineered and produced and for a disruptive renovation of the electrical and software architecture of the car. In this paper we describe the current investigation of Volvo Cars to create an architecture framework able to cope with the complexity and needs of present and future vehicles. Specifically, we present scenarios that describe demands for the architectural framework and introduce three new viewpoints that need to be taken into account for future architectural decisions: Continuous Integration and Deployment, Ecosystem and Transparency, and car as a constituent of a System of Systems. Our results are based on a series of focus groups with experts in automotive engineering and architecture from different companies and universities.","Architecture framework, Automotive domain, Automotive ecosystem, Continuous integration and deployment, Software architecture, Systems of Systems",,,,,,,,"<How KETs can contribute to the re-industrialisation of Europe, {eid: 85020620820}>, <A proposal for an automotive architecture framework for Volvo Cars, {eid: 84978258746, doi: 10.1109/WASA.2016.9}>, <None, {eid: 85020619457}>, <Toward a holistic and standardized automotive architecture description, {eid: 73449140146}>, <None, {eid: 84957056085}>, <Viewpoints: a framework for integrating multiple perspectives in system development, {eid: 0003112251}>, <The 4+1 view model of architecture, {eid: 0029408391}>, <Software Systems Architecture: Working With Stakeholders Using Viewpoints and Perspectives, {eid: 33751002702}>, <Documenting Software Architectures: Views and Beyond, {eid: 0006029493}>, <The Process of Software Architecting, {eid: 77958190800}>, <Every architecture description needs a framework: expressing architecture frameworks using ISO/IEC 42010, {eid: 74349118841}>, <None, {eid: 85020690691}>, <None, {eid: 85020643792}>, <None, {eid: 85020643819}>, <None, {eid: 85020646390}>, <None, {eid: 84870680275}>, <SADT: Structured Analysis and Design Technique, {eid: 0004133986}>, <Unified Modeling Language User Guide, The (2Nd Edition) (Addison-Wesley Object Technology Series), {eid: 0003547470}>, <The east-adl architecture description language for automotive embedded software, {eid: 78449253285}>, <A Practical Guide to SysML: Systems Modeling Language, {eid: 85013989545}>, <Automotive Architecture Framework: Towards a Holistic and Standardised System Architecture Description, {eid: 77950427624}>, <Towards an architectural design framework for automotive systems development, {eid: 84883885003, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-34404-6_16}>, <What industry needs from architectural languages: a survey, {eid: 84878389746}>, <A classification and comparison framework for software architecture description languages, {eid: 0033892696}>, <Automotive software development: a model based approach, {eid: 85072506138}>, <Architecting in the automotive domain: descriptive vs. prescriptive architecture, {eid: 84943248995, doi: 10.1109/WICSA.2015.18}>, <Descriptive vs. prescriptive models in industry, {eid: 85008425440}>, <The road ahead for architectural languages, {eid: 84922874903, doi: 10.1109/MS.2014.28}>, <What do software architects really do?, {eid: 53949091609, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2008.08.025}>, <Organic evolution of development organizations-an experience report, {eid: 85072357057}>, <How much up-front?

Embracing automation at every layer of performance management enables us to reduce costs while improving outcomes. The main contribution of this paper is the definition of autonomic management requirements of Cloud-native applications. We propose that the automation is achieved via high-level policies. In turn autonomy features are accomplished via the rule engine support. First, the paper presents the engineering perspective of building a framework for Autonomic Management of Cloud-Native Applications, namely AMoCNA, in accordance with Model Driven Architecture (MDA) concepts. AMoCNA has many desirable features whose main goal is to reduce the complexity of managing Cloud-native applications. The presented models are, in fact, meta-models, being technology agnostic. Secondly, the paper demonstrates one possibility of implementing the aforementioned design procedures. The presented AMoCNA implementation is also evaluated to identify the potential overhead introduced by the framework.","Autonomic Computing (AC), Cloud-native, Observability, Policy-driven management, Resource management",,,,,,,,"<Rule engine based lightweight framework for adaptive and autonomic computing, {eid: 47749149969}>, <None, {eid: 77951168228}>, <Orchestrating complex application architectures in heterogeneous clouds, {eid: 85091492884}>, <Resource-Definition Policies for Autonomic Computing, {eid: 67650673423}>, <None, {eid: 85065797199}>, <None, {eid: 85091487278}>, <An sla- based broker for cloud infrastructures, {eid: 84874663533, doi: 10.1007/s10723-012-9241-4}>, <Building lean continuous integration and delivery pipelines by applying devops principles: A case study at varidesk, {eid: 85058271814}>, <Dependable mesh networking patterns, {eid: 85076670133}>, <None, {eid: 85091495200}>, <None, {eid: 85091487217}>, <None, {eid: 85091479034}>, <None, {eid: 85091520036}>, <None, {eid: 0141684320}>, <None, {eid: 67651248827}>, <The dawning of the autonomic computing era, {eid: 0037236308, doi: 10.1147/sj.421.0005}>, <Data-Driven Monitoring for Cloud Compute Systems, {eid: 85009097790}>, <Iaasmon: Monitoring architecture for public cloud computing data centers, {eid: 84960102697, doi: 10.1007/s10723-015-9357-4}>, <None, {eid: 85091509890}>, <A survey of autonomic computing – degrees, models, and applications, {eid: 42449088961, doi: 10.1145/1380584.1380585}>, <None, {eid: 85091488312}>, <None, {eid: 85091531968}>, <None, {eid: 85091486634}>, <None, {eid: 85091539340}>, <None, {eid: 85091502096}>, <On the general theory of control systems, {eid: 84936764522, doi: 10.1109/TAC.1959.1104873}>, <The vision of autonomic computing, {eid: 0037253062, doi: 10.1109/MC.2003.1160055}>, <None, {eid: 85040769709}>, <Adaptive SOA solution stack, {eid: 84861921234, doi: 10.1109/TSC.2011.8}>, <None, {eid: 85091523873}>, <Supporting programmable autoscaling rules for containers and virtual machines on clouds, {eid: 85072128121, doi: 10.1007/s10723-019-09488-w}>, <A brief history of cloud application architectures, {eid: 85051750704, doi: 10.3390/app8081368}>, <Clouns - A Cloud-native Application Reference Model for Enterprise Architects, {eid: 85091479401}>, <Intellectual Property and Open Source: A Practical Guide to Protecting Code, 1 edn.

In particular, they need to be flexible in order to cope with dynamism in different forms (e.g. service and data providers and consumers). The current trend to build applications out of remote services makes the availability of constituent application components inherently dynamic. Developers can no longer assume that applications are static after development or at run time. Unfortunately, developing applications that are able to cope with dynamism is very complex. Existing development approaches do not provide explicit support for managing dynamism. In this paper we describe Rondo, a tool suite for designing pervasive applications. More specifically, we present our propositions in pervasive application specification, which borrows concepts from service-oriented component assembly, model-driven engineering (MDE) and continuous deployment, resulting in a more flexible approach than traditional application definitions. Then the capabilities of our application model are demonstrated with an example application scenario designed using our approach.

Existing RTS approaches based on UML models use behavioral diagrams or a combination of structural and behavioral diagrams. However, in practice, behavioral diagrams are incomplete or not used. In previous work, we proposed a fuzzy logic based RTS approach called FLiRTS that uses UML sequence and activity diagrams. In this work, we introduce FLiRTS 2, which drops the need for behavioral diagrams and relies on system models that only use UML class diagrams, which are the most widely used UML diagrams in practice. FLiRTS 2 addresses the unavailability of behavioral diagrams by classifying test cases using fuzzy logic after analyzing the information commonly provided in class diagrams. We evaluated FLiRTS 2 on UML class diagrams extracted from 3331 revisions of 13 open-source software systems, and compared the results with those of code-based dynamic (Ekstazi) and static (STARTS) RTS approaches. The average test suite reduction using FLiRTS 2 was 82.06%. The average safety violations of FLiRTS 2 with respect to Ekstazi and STARTS were 18.88% and 16.53%, respectively. FLiRTS 2 selected on average about 82% of the test cases that were selected by Ekstazi and STARTS. The average precision violations of FLiRTS 2 with respect to Ekstazi and STARTS were 13.27% and 9.01%, respectively. The average mutation score of the full test suites was 18.90%; the standard deviation of the reduced test suites from the average deviation of the mutation score for each subject was 1.78% for FLiRTS 2, 1.11% for Ekstazi, and 1.43% for STARTS. Our experiment demonstrated that the performance of FLiRTS 2 is close to the state-of-art tools for code-based RTS but requires less information and performs the selection in less time.","Class diagram, Fuzzy logic, Regression test selection, UML",,,,,,,,"<An extension of class diagram to model the structure of context-aware systems, {eid: 85110943912}>, <A fuzzy logic based approach for model-based regression test selection, {eid: 85040586834}>, <Model-based regression test selection for validating runtime adaptation of software systems, {eid: 84983288652}>, <Supporting inheritance hierarchy changes in model-based regression test selection, {eid: 85037103803, doi: 10.1007/s10270-017-0636-3}>, <Is mutation an appropriate tool for testing experiments?, {eid: 84994006258}>, <ReTEST: A cost effective test case selection technique for modern software development, {eid: 85059652407}>, <Extended UML for the development of context-aware applications, {eid: 84880478665}>, <None, {eid: 84924717453, doi: 10.1017/CBO9780511801129}>, <None, {eid: 85055572256}>, <Heavyweight extension to the UML class diagram metamodel for modeling context aware systems in ubiquitous computing, {eid: 85031778537}>, <Automating regression test selection based on UML designs, {eid: 56649118931, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2008.09.010}>, <Model differences in the eclipse modeling framework, {eid: 70849087833}>, <Fine-grained software evolution using UML activity and class models, {eid: 84886838477}>, <Fine-grained semi-automated runtime evolution, {eid: 84904811259}>, <Specification-based regression test selection with risk analysis, {eid: 24944502842}>, <jFuzzyLogic: a java library to design fuzzy logic controllers according to the standard for fuzzy control programming, {eid: 84880075316, doi: 10.1080/18756891.2013.818190}>, <A study on techniques for the automatic generation of membership functions for pattern recognition, {eid: 73649114627}>, <PIT: A practical mutation testing tool for java, {eid: 84984920723}>, <Ten years of genetic fuzzy systems: current framework and new trends, {eid: 0346781553, doi: 10.1016/S0165-0114(03)00111-8}>, <None, {eid: 79959245159, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-00234-2}>, <None, {eid: 85110938570}>, <How UML is used, {eid: 33745921784, doi: 10.1145/1125944.1125949}>, <A realistic empirical evaluation of the costs and benefits of UML in software maintenance, {eid: 45449102151, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2008.15}>, <A systematic review on regression test selection techniques, {eid: 70350570383, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2009.07.001}>, <A model-based regression testing approach for evolving software systems with flexible tool support, {eid: 77953222030}>, <On the use of uml documentation in software maintenance: results from a survey in industry, {eid: 84961575335}>, <None, {eid: 85110943133}>, <Analyze your classes, {eid: 85110992662}>, <Dynamic update of java applications-balancing change flexibility vs programming transparency, {eid: 63849136008, doi: 10.1002/smr.406}>, <Does UML make the grade?

In this vision paper we argue that the cognification of MDSE has the potential to reverse this situation. Cognification is the application of knowledge (inferred from large volumes of information, artificial intelligence or collective intelligence) to boost the performance and impact of a process. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of cognifying MDSE tasks and we describe some potential scenarios where cognification can bring quantifiable and perceivable advantages. And conversely, we also discuss how MDSE techniques themselves can help in the improvement of AI, Machine learning, bot generation and other cognification techniques.","AI, Bot, Machine learning, Model, Model-driven",,,,,,,,"<Process mining manifesto, {eid: 84863011087}>, <Integrating modeling languages and web logs for enhanced user behavior analytics, {eid: 85042675932}>, <A big data analysis framework for model-based web user behavior analytics, {eid: 85020522698}>, <Practical change impact analysis based on static program slicing for industrial software systems, {eid: 79959896935}>, <Experiences in the design of semantic services using web engineering methods and tools, {eid: 58849090949}>, <Extracting emerging knowledge from social media, {eid: 85042675241}>, <None, {eid: 84910605779}>, <Practical change impact analysis based on static program slicing for industrial software systems, {eid: 79959896935}>, <An online platform for semantic validation of UML models, {eid: 70350217788}>, <None, {eid: 84892828610}>, <Continuing a benchmark for UML and OCL design and analysis tools, {eid: 85007343649}>, <Restart strategy selection using machine learning techniques, {eid: 70350640707}>, <The next evolution of MDE: A seamless integration of machine learning into domain modeling, {eid: 85040582253}>, <Model-driven engineering practices in industry: Social, organizational and managerial factors that lead to success or failure, {eid: 84900499307}>, <Boosting verification by automatic tuning of decision procedures, {eid: 47349133530}>, <Algorithm runtime prediction: Methods & evaluation, {eid: 84887848457}>, <JSONDiscoverer: Visualizing the schema lurking behind JSON documents, {eid: 84964344814}>, <None, {eid: 85006857689}>, <Search-based model transformation by example, {eid: 84860470004}>, <An evaluation of machine learning in algorithm selection for search problems, {eid: 84865481979}>, <Recommending auto-completions for software modeling activities, {eid: 84886842342}>, <A machine learning technique for predicting the productivity of practitioners from individually developed software projects, {eid: 85042633394}>, <Practical change impact analysis based on static program slicing for industrial software systems, {eid: 79959896935}>, <Proactive modeling: Auto-generating models from their semantics and constraints, {eid: 84872119757}>, <The rise of the (Modelling) bots: Towards assisted modelling via social networks, {eid: 85041439636}>, <A machine learning approach to software requirements prioritization, {eid: 84875692349}>, <Researcher bias: The use of machine learning in software defect prediction, {eid: 84903176990}>, <Model-driven adaptation for plastic user interfaces, {eid: 38049105307}>, <Generic model assist, {eid: 84886838174}>, <Two’s company, three’s a crowd: A case study of crowdsourcing software development, {eid: 84994141774}>, <Systematic literature review of machine learning based software development effort estimation models, {eid: 80055086827}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,2017-07-17,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85042643413,True,False,False,True

We find that practitioners desire to adopt shorter development cycles, but immature modeling practices slow them down. We describe the different patterns that emerge from the various industrial settings. There is an opportunity for researchers to provide practitioners with a migration path toward practices that enable more automated consistency management, and ultimately, continuous model-based development.","Agile, Consistency management, Model-based development",,,,,,,,"<The integration of agile development and model driven development—A systematic literature review, {eid: 85041446030}>,

Our approach provides an automatic updating technique to deal with changes that happen frequently in agile software development. Consistency reflection by automatic updating allows us to cut off manual tasks required in maintaining automated tests and speed up testing process which is a bottleneck in service development lifecycle. We introduce the use of metadata, data structure that describes structural behavior of the system, in our automatic updating technique. Metadata is used as a common medium for communicating changes to keep consistency among design, system under test, and test components.

The normative, anticipated behavior of a software system as envisaged during its development and the de facto, observed behavior emerging after its continued operation tends to drift apart, resulting in behavioral inconsistency.

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Design-Time evaluation is essential to build the initial software architecture to be deployed. However, experts' assumptions made at design-Time are unlikely to remain true indefinitely in systems that are characterized by scale, hyperconnectivity, dynamism, and uncertainty in operations (e.g. IoT). Therefore, experts' design-Time decisions can be challenged at run-Time. A continuous architecture evaluation that systematically assesses and intertwines design-Time and run-Time decisions is thus necessary. This paper proposes the first proactive approach to continuous architecture evaluation of the system leveraging the support of simulation. The approach evaluates software architectures by not only tracking their performance over time, but also forecasting their likely future performance through machine learning of simulated instances of the architecture. This enables architects to make cost-effective informed decisions on potential changes to the architecture. We perform an IoT case study to show how machine learning on simulated instances of architecture can fundamentally guide the continuous evaluation process and influence the outcome of architecture decisions. A series of experiments is conducted to demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the approach. We also provide the architect with recommendations on how to best benefit from the approach through choice of learners and input parameters, grounded on experimentation and evidence.","Continuous

As an aid to designers and developers, we developed OSTIA (On-the-fly Static Topology Inference Analysis) that allows: (a) visualising big data architectures for the purpose of design-time refactoring while maintaining constraints that would only be evaluated at later stages such as deployment and run-time, (b) detecting the occurrence of common anti-patterns across big data architectures, (c) exploiting software verification techniques on the elicited architectural models.

A major challenge is the high heterogeneity of their infrastructure, which broadens the surface for security attacks and increases the complexity of maintaining and evolving such complex systems. In this paper, we present our approach for Generation and Deployment of Smart IoT Systems (GeneSIS) to tame this complexity. GeneSIS leverages model-driven engineering to support the DevSecOps of Smart IoT Systems (SIS). More precisely, GeneSIS includes: (i) a domain specific modelling language to specify the deployment of SIS over IoT, Edge and Cloud infrastructure with the necessary concepts for security and privacy; and (ii) a models@run. time engine to enact the orchestration, deployment, and adaptation of these SIS. The results from our smart building case study have shown that GeneSIS can support security by design from the development (via deployment) to the operation of IoT systems and back again in a DevSecOps loop. In other words, GeneSIS enables IoT systems to keep up security and adapt to evolving conditions and threats while maintaining their trustworthiness.","DecSecOps, Deployment, DSL, IoT, MDE, Models@run. time",,,,,,,,"<Understanding the software communications architecture, {eid: 70350324202}>, <Rearchitecting the UML infrastructure, {eid: 0141796082}>, <None, {eid: 85008066028}>, <A systematic review of cloud modeling languages, {eid: 85042469266}>, <D-lite: Distributed logic for internet of things services, {eid: 84857617841}>, <Software deployment, past, present and future, {eid: 34748846536}>, <Opentosca for iot: Automating the deployment of iot applications based on the mosquitto message broker, {eid: 85000926700}>, <None, {eid: 85067431815}>, <Cloudmf: Model-driven management of multi-cloud applications, {eid: 85041437398}>, <Development and operation of trustworthy smart IoT systems: The ENACT framework, {eid: 85079102926}>, <Genesis: Continuous orchestration and deployment of smart iot systems, {eid: 85072692587}>, <Enact: Development, operation, and quality assurance of trustworthy smart iot systems, {eid: 85061085691}>, <Developing iot applications in the fog: A distributed dataflow approach, {eid: 84962284412}>, <None, {eid: 24344495942}>, <Thingml: A language and code generation framework for heterogeneous targets, {eid: 85008457888}>, <A generic service oriented software platform to design ambient intelligent systems, {eid: 84962524282}>, <Calvin constrained-a framework for iot applications in heterogeneous environments, {eid: 85027276378}>, <Devsecops: A multivocal literature review, {eid: 85029742916}>, <Advances in deployment and orchestration approaches for IoT-a systematic review, {eid: 85072691780}>, <Towards a smart applications development framework, {eid: 85089682565}>, <A conceptual foundation for component-based software deployment, {eid: 0035878887}>",,,Association Internationale pour les Technologies Objets,,,2020-07-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85089665982,True,False,False,False

All rights reserved.Background. Systems modeling in Production Systems Engineering (PSE) is complex: Multiple views from different disciplines have to be integrated, while semantic differences stemming from various descriptions must be bridged. Aim. This paper proposes the Multi-view Modeling Framework (MvMF) approach and architecture of a model transformation pipeline. The approach aims to ease setup and shorten configuration effort of multi-view modeling operations and support the reusability of modeling environments, like additional view integration. Method. We combine multi-view modeling with principles from distributed, agile workflows, i.e., Git and Continuous Integration. Results. The MvMF provides a light-weight modeling operation environment for AutomationML (AML) models. We show MvMF capabilities and demonstrate the feasibility of MvMF with a demonstrating use case including fundamental model operation features, such as compare and merge. Conclusion. Increasing requirements on the traceability of changes and validation of system designs require improved and extended model transformations and integration mechanisms.

Reaching this level of performance is subject to several engineering challenges such as energy consumption, equipment-cooling, reliability and massive parallelism. Model-based optimization is an essential tool in the design process and control of energy efficient, reliable and thermally constrained systems. However, in the Exascale domain, model learning techniques tailored to the specific supercomputer require real measurements and must therefore handle and analyze a massive amount of data coming from the HPC monitoring infrastructure. This becomes rapidly a 'big data' scale problem. The common approach where measurements are first stored in large databases and then processed is no more affordable due to the increasingly storage costs and lack of real-time support. Nowadays instead, cloud-based machine learning techniques aim to build on-line models using real-time approaches such as 'stream processing' and 'in-memory' computing, that avoid storage costs and enable fastdata processing. Moreover, the fast delivery and adaptation of the models to the quick data variations, make the decision stage of the optimization loop more effective and reliable. In this paper we leverage scalable, lightweight and flexible IoT technologies, such as the MQTT protocol, to build a highly scalable HPC monitoring infrastructure able to handle the massive sensor data produced by next-gen HPC components. We then show how state-of-the art tools for big data computing and analysis, such as Apache Spark, can be used to manage the huge amount of data delivered by the monitoring layer and to build adaptive models in real-time using on-line machine learning techniques.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84055195466}>, <Energy-aware performance analysis methodologies for HPC architectures: An exploratory study, {eid: 84867558905}>, <None, {eid: 84977561627}>, <Fault tolerance in petascale/exascale systems: Current knowledge, {eid: 68249127079}>, <Energyaware cooling for hot-water cooled supercomputers, {eid: 84944594636}>, <The International Exascale Software Project roadmap, {eid: 79951595196}>, <Understandable big data: A survey, {eid: 84940452273}>, <Correlation analysis of mqtt loss and delay according to qos level, {eid: 84876781830}>, <None, {eid: 84903709403}>, <The ganglia distributed monitoring system: Design, implementation, and experience, {eid: 3342966061}>, <Open source initiatives and frameworks addressing distributed real-time data analytics, {eid: 84991677313}>, <Maximizing throughput of overprovisioned HPC data centers under a strict power budget, {eid: 84936949338}>, <Exascale computing technology challenges, {eid: 79952579787}>, <Whitelisting msrs with msr-safe, {eid: 84966583761}>, <Monitoring power data: A first step towards a unified energy efficiency evaluation toolset for HPC data centers, {eid: 84901290949}>, <Towards data-driven autonomics in data centers, {eid: 84962127890}>, <Resilient distributed datasets: A fault-tolerant abstraction for in-memory cluster computing, {eid: 85040175609}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2017-03-27,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85020177368,True,False,True,False

The need for rigorous and continuous development of highly networked software-intensive Industry 4.0 systems entails great challenges. Hence, Industry 4.0 requires new ways to develop, operate, and evolve these systems accordingly. Objective: We introduce the view of Continuous Systems and Software Engineering for Industry 4.0 (CSSE I4.0).

Software repositories are commonly used in practice for locating existing artifacts provided that a classification procedure is available. However, the manual classification of metamodel in repositories produces results that are influenced by the subjectivity of human perception besides being tedious and prone to errors. Therefore, automated techniques for classifying metamodels stored in repositories are highly desirable and stringent. In this work, we propose MEMOCNN as a novel approach to classification of metamodels. In particular, we consider metamodels as data points and classify them using supervised learning techniques. A convolutional neural network has been built to learn from labeled data, and use the trained weights to group unlabeled metamodels.

This becomes more problematic when Continuous Integration (CI) practices are adopted. CI leads the software to be integrated and tested multiple times a day, subject to time constraints (budgets). To address CI challenges, a learning-based test case prioritization approach named COLEMAN has been successfully applied. COLEMAN deals with test case volatility, in which some test cases can be included/removed over the CI cycles. Nevertheless, such an approach does not consider HCS particularities such as, by analogy, the volatility of variants. Given such a context, this work introduces two strategies for applying COLEMAN in the CI of HCS: the Variant Test Set Strategy (VTS) that relies on the test set specific for each variant; and the Whole Test Set Strategy (WST) that prioritizes the test set composed by the union of the test cases of all variants. Both strategies are applied to two real-world HCSs, considering three test budgets. Independently of the time budget, the proposed strategies using COLEMAN have the best performance in comparison with solutions generated randomly and by another learning approach from the literature. Moreover, COLEMAN produces, in more than 92% of the cases, reasonable solutions that are near to the optimal solutions obtained by a deterministic approach. Both strategies spend less than one second to execute. WTS provides better results in the less restrictive budgets, and VTS the opposite. WTS seems to better mitigate the problem of beginning without knowledge, and is more suitable when a new variant to be tested is added.","Continuous integration, Highly-configurable software, Software product line, Test case prioritization",,,,,,,,"<Delta-oriented product prioritization for similarity-based product-line testing, {eid: 85027114086}>, <A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, {eid: 79959871222}>, <Learning-to-rank vs ranking-to-learn: Strategies for regression testing in continuous integration, {eid: 85094318353}>, <None, {eid: 84961347393}>, <History-Based Test Case Prioritization for Failure Information, {eid: 85018510656}>, <A review of ten years of the symposium on search-based software engineering, {eid: 85072863599}>, <None, {eid: 0003414693}>, <An empirical study of the effect of time constraints on the cost-benefits of regression testing, {eid: 77950490739}>, <Continuous integration: Improving software quality and reducing risk, {eid: 84942757453}>, <Techniques for improving regression testing in continuous integration development environments, {eid: 84986877429}>, <Regression test selection and product line system testing, {eid: 77954527991}>, <Goal-oriented test case selection and prioritization for product line feature models, {eid: 80051528149}>, <Validation of constraints among configuration parameters using search-based combinatorial interaction testing, {eid: 84989813040}>, <Test prioritization in continuous integration environments, {eid: 85053760573, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2018.08.061}>, <Automating system test case classification and prioritization for use case-driven testing in product lines, {eid: 85089602675}>, <Automated code-based test selection for software product line regression testing, {eid: 85072228048, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2019.110419}>, <Rajkumar: Test case prioritization techniques for software product line: A survey, {eid: 85011114125}>, <Risk-based integration testing of software product lines, {eid: 85014902435}>, <Delta-oriented test case prioritization for integration testing of software product lines, {eid: 84982811054}>, <Adaptive operator selection with bandits for a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition, {eid: 84893865972}>, <Retest test selection for product-line regression testing of variants and versions of variants, {eid: 85054466985}>, <Incremental model-based testing of delta-oriented software product lines, {eid: 84862204405}>, <On a test of whether one of two random variables is stochastically larger than the other, {eid: 0002322469}>, <Multi-perspective regression test prioritization for time-constrained environments, {eid: 84962091042}>, <A learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration development and testing practice, {eid: 85056634616}>, <A learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration development and testing practice, {eid: 85056634616}>, <Test case prioritization for continuous regression testing: An industrial case study, {eid: 84891715780}>, <Test prioritization with optimally balanced configuration coverage, {eid: 85019254116}>, <Titan: Test suite optimization for highly configurable software, {eid: 85020723577}>, <A comparison of 10 sampling algorithms for configurable systems, {eid: 84971414235}>, <Discipline matters: Refactoring of preprocessor directives in the #ifdef hell, {eid: 85047010689}>, <Tackling combinatorial explosion: A study of industrial needs and practices for analyzing highly configurable systems, {eid: 85056534298}>, <On the evolution of feature dependencies: An exploratory study of preprocessor-based systems, {eid: 85123042832}>, <Stability of Product-Line Sampling in Continuous Integration.

It promotes to capture relevant domain concepts in domain models in order to define a ubiquitous language, whose terms are well understood by stakeholders and consistently used throughout the software engineering process. DDD is considered particularly useful in Microservice Architecture (MSA) engineering, because it specifies patterns to structure modeled domain concepts in isolated contexts. These contexts determine concepts' applicability and validity, and make relationships between domain concepts beyond context boundaries explicit. Consequently, DDD contexts may be used to prescribe microservices' granularities and interaction relationships. However, domain models are usually underspecified, which facilitates communication with domain experts, but hampers the derivation of microservice code.In this paper, we present a model-driven methodology towards deriving microservice code from underspecified domain models. It relies on a set of viewpoint-based MSA modeling languages, which respect the concerns of DevOps teams, and a set of automatic model transformations, which decrease modeling effort and systematize source code derivation. We validate the applicability of our methodology by means of two case studies.","Modeling of computer architecture, Services Architectures, Services Engineering",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84950338538}>, <None, {eid: 2942742234}>, <None, {eid: 85010410859}>, <A pattern language for scalable microservices-based systems, {eid: 85055721495}>, <Microservices: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, {eid: 85054938535}>, <Microservices in industry: Insights into technologies, characteristics, and software quality, {eid: 85066486037}>, <Challenges of domaindriven microservice design: A model-driven perspective, {eid: 85046890847}>, <Linking modeldriven development and software architecture: A case study, {eid: 60449116881}>, <Microservice ambients: An architectural meta-modelling approach for microservice granularity, {eid: 85021456926}>, <None, {eid: 84878326137}>, <Towards a uml profile for domain-driven design of microservice architectures, {eid: 85042075507}>, <Graphical and textual model-driven microservice development, {eid: 85086303989}>, <Aspect-oriented modeling of technology heterogeneity in microservice architecture, {eid: 85065789976}>, <Integration of handwritten and generated object-oriented code, {eid: 84955263298}>, <Systems and software engineering-architecture description, {eid: 72349086391}>, <Microservices architecture enables devops: Migration to a cloud-native architecture, {eid: 84968796741}>, <Continuous architecting with microservices and devops: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85071500372}>, <Generative software module development for domain-driven design with annotation-based domain specific language, {eid: 85076243410}>, <Rapid realization of executable domain models via automatic code generation, {eid: 85049258166}>, <Development and evaluation of microbuilder: A model-driven tool for the specification of rest microservice software architectures, {eid: 85044973439}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2020-08-26,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096547404,True,True,False,False

However, when introducing new code to projects these rules can be violated. As a result, architectural erosion, bad smells, or even bugs that can be difficult to find are introduced to the projects. This paper proposes an approach for reviewing compliance to predefined rules that map architectural decisions to code. During the continuous integration process, the automatic analysis raises an issue for each rule violation. Developers can analyze and correct issues, and trace/visualize improvements, or lack thereof, through time. We present a validation experiment carried out in the context of a Software Development course, and we show how the approach helps developers to write better code.","Architectural rules, Continuous integration, Issue identification, Issue visualization, Rule violation",,,,,,,,"<Architectural bad smells in software product lines, {eid: 84904549333, doi: 10.1145/2578128.2578237}>, <None, {eid: 84889956825}>, <Software architecture in practice, {eid: 0004025223, doi: 10.1024/0301-1526.32.1.54}>, <An architectural smells detection tool for c and c++ projects, {eid: 85057141088}>, <Teaching clean code, {eid: 85044541080}>, <None, {eid: 0004061016}>, <A method for detecting bad smells and ITS application to software engineering education, {eid: 84918555406, doi: 10.1109/IIAI-AAI.2014.139}>, <Software architecture as A set of architectural design decisions, {eid: 33947154413}>, <Spotting the phenomenon of bad smells in MobileMedia product line architecture, {eid: 84908611568, doi: 10.1109/IC3.2014.6897200}>, <A comparison of static architecture compliance checking approaches, {eid: 34547169524}>, <Benefits and drawbacks of reference architectures, {eid: 84879860179, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-39031-926}>, <Restructure101 for Java, {eid: 85080327241}>, <Software architecture: Foundations, theory, and practice, {eid: 77954720414, doi: 10.1145/1810295.1810435}>, <None, {eid: 33751002702}>, <Code smell analyzer: A tool to teaching support of refactoring techniques source code, {eid: 84963951626, doi: 10.1109/TLA.2016.7437235}>, <Recommending refactorings to reverse software architecture erosion, {eid: 84860503189}>, <How to improve code quality by measurement and refactoring, {eid: 85013761756, doi: 10.1109/QUATIC.2016.034}>, <Characterization and automatic detection of bad smells MVC, {eid: 85049189336, doi: 10.17013/risti.26.54-67}>, <Towards detecting MVC architectural smells, {eid: 85032694896, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-69341-523}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-09-15,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85075921993,True,False,False,False

Accelerating their maintenance and continuous improvement, while ensuring their availability, is complex. DevOps promotes fast and continuous feedback from operations to development to detect problems before customers are impacted, among other benefits. However, there is not any formal definition of how to do this. This article defines the 'fast and continuous monitoring feedback of system availability' activity (FCF availability) that supports automatic and continuous monitoring feedback from operations to the development of the IoT system availability. This activity has been formalized through the software and systems process engineering metamodel (SPEM). Its implementation is demonstrated in a real scenario that provides evidence that the formalization of the FCF availability activity helps teams in better diagnosing and fixing outage problems. The result is a distributed and configurable monitoring component developed through code [monitoring as code (MaC)]. This component is embedded in the IoT infrastructure. MaC enables DevOps team to configure their own metrics and indicators at runtime, i.e., monitoring on demand. The formalization of this activity, based on an MaC technique, enables the automation, versioning, and replication of monitoring elements.","Availability, continuous monitoring, DevOps, fast and continuous feedback activity, Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems",,,,,,,,"<Understanding the Internet of Things: Definition, potentials, and societal role of a fast evolving paradigm, {eid: 85009285034}>, <Introduction to the internet of things, {eid: 84956476081, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-40403-0}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <None, {eid: 85173029256}>, <Current and future challenges of software engineering for services and applications, {eid: 84998698759}>, <Relationship of DevOps to agile, lean and continuous deployment, {eid: 84999040028}>, <An exploratory study of DevOps extending the dimensions of DevOps with practices, {eid: 84998881112}>, <Towards definitions for release engineering and DevOps, {eid: 84962216125}>, <None, {eid: 85018529770}>, <Towards DevOps in the embedded systems domain: Why is it so hard?, {eid: 84975460866}>, <Agile processes: Challenges and strategies for undertaking continuous experimentation to embedded systems: Industry and research perspectives, {eid: 85048052155}>, <None, {eid: 77949517037}>, <A qualitative study of DevOps usage in practice, {eid: 85021358087}>, <Introduction to the minitrack on IT governance and its mechanisms, {eid: 85060475722}>, <None, {eid: 85073237331}>, <None, {eid: 84903828209}>, <A survey of commercial frameworks for the Internet of Things, {eid: 84952907595}>, <A survey of IoT cloud platforms, {eid: 85033708211}>, <None, {eid: 85092728057}>, <None, {eid: 84963757817}>, <None, {eid: 84958964990}>, <Fog computing and its role in the Internet of Things characterization of fog computing, {eid: 84866627419}>, <Future Internet: The Internet of Things architecture, possible applications and key challenges, {eid: 84874174122}>, <Fog computing: Platform and applications, {eid: 84969509112}>, <IFCIoT: Integrated fog cloud IoT: A novel architectural paradigm for the future Internet of Things, {eid: 85021058978}>, <INDICES: Exploiting edge resources for performanceaware cloud-hosted services, {eid: 85027465225}>, <Agile infrastructure and operations: How infra-gile are you?, {eid: 52949150488}>, <Toward unified DevOps model, {eid: 84958247265}>, <Key affordances of platform- asa-service: Self-organization and continuous feedback, {eid: 85055527652}>, <Microservices architecture enables DevOps: Migration to a cloud-native architecture, {eid: 84968796741}>, <Selfservice cybersecurity monitoring as enabler for DevSecOps, {eid: 85084859519}>, <ENACT: Development, operation, and quality assurance of trustworthy smart IoT systems, {eid: 85092710058}>, <DevOps for IoT applications using cellular networks and cloud, {eid: 84992036313}>, <Enabling operation data visibility for SmartX-MINI IoT-cloud playground, {eid: 84979996132}>, <Automated deployment of SmartX IoTcloud services based on continuous integration, {eid: 85015804380}>, <Cloud ecosystems support for Internet of Things and DevOps using patterns, {eid: 84977609466}>, <None, {eid: 85092739167}>, <Reliability and availability evaluation of wireless sensor networks for industrial applications, {eid: 84856247989}>, <None, {eid: 0003673547}>, <A documentation framework for architecture decisions, {eid: 84857356116}>, <Qualitative methods in empirical studies of software engineering, {eid: 0033163750}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2020-10-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85092738657,True,True,False,False

Both DevOps and MDE aim at shortening the development life-cycle, dealing with complexity, and improve software process and product quality. The integration of DevOps and MDE principles and practices in low-code engineering platforms (LCEP) are gaining attention by the research community. However, at the same time, new requirements are upcoming for DevOps and MDE as LCEPs are often used by non-technical users, to deliver fully functional software. This is in particular challenging for current DevOps processes, which are mostly considered on the technological level, and thus, excluding most of the current LCEP users. The systematic use of models and modeling to lowering the learning curve of DevOps processes and platforms seems beneficial to make them also accessible for non-technical users. In this paper, we introduce DevOpsML, a conceptual framework for modeling and combining DevOps processes and platforms. Tools along with their interfaces and capabilities are the building blocks of DevOps platform configurations, which can be mapped to software engineering processes of arbitrary complexity. We show our initial endeavors on DevOpsML and present a research roadmap how to employ the resulting DevOpsML framework for different use cases.","DevOps, Model-driven engineering, Modeling languages",,,,,,,,"<The multi process challenge, {eid: 85075927615}>, <None, {eid: 85096751792}>, <Modeling devops deployment choices using process architecture design dimensions, {eid: 84952662031}>, <Model driven engineering: An emerging technical space, {eid: 33750045718}>, <None, {eid: 85096790510}>, <None, {eid: 85096779854}>, <Towards modeling framework for devops: Requirements derived from industry use case, {eid: 85079101956}>, <None, {eid: 84878326137}>, <Process-centered model engineering, {eid: 33645491644}>, <Contents for a model-based software engineering body of knowledge, {eid: 85069478287}>, <None, {eid: 85075598452}>, <Blended modelling-what, why and how, {eid: 85075926513}>, <Slebok: The software language engineering body of knowledge (dagstuhl seminar 17342), {eid: 85055482539}>, <Towards a model-based devops for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85079099244}>, <Aiops: Real-world challenges and research innovations, {eid: 85071852727}>, <The tao of modeling spaces, {eid: 33846101237}>, <None, {eid: 84889269573}>, <None, {eid: 85096811836}>, <None, {eid: 85096743853}>, <Stepwise adoption of continuous delivery in model-driven engineering, {eid: 85061101819}>, <Characterizing and evaluating the quality of software process modeling language: Comparison of ten representative model-based languages, {eid: 85057788064}>, <None, {eid: 84969784175}>, <What is devops?

In this paper, we consider the question of how quality-aware MDE should support data-intensive software systems. This is a difficult challenge, since existing models and QA techniques largely ignore properties of data such as volumes, velocities, or data location. Furthermore, QA requires the ability to characterize the behavior of technologies such as Hadoop/MapReduce, NoSQL, and stream-based processing, which are poorly understood from a modeling standpoint. To foster a community response to these challenges, we present the research agenda of DICE, a quality-aware MDE methodology for data-intensive cloud applications. DICE aims at developing a quality engineering tool chain offering simulation, verification, and architectural optimization for Big Data applications. We overview some key challenges involved in developing these tools and the underpinning models.","Big data, Model-driven engineering, Quality assurance",,,,,,,,"<MODAClouds: A modeldriven approach for the design and execution of applications on multiple Clouds, {eid: 84864997201}>, <Dependability modeling and analysis of software systems specified with UML, {eid: 84871237155}>, <Devops A software revolution in the making?, {eid: 84940375618}>, <A framework for utility-based service oriented design in SASSY, {eid: 77950509895}>, <Automatically improve software architecture models for performance, reliability, and cost using evolutionary algorithms, {eid: 77950538861}>, <Space4Cloud: A tool for system performance and cost evaluation of cloud systems, {eid: 84879756696}>, <Assessing SLA compliance from Palladio component models, {eid: 84904556663}>, <Estimating computational requirements in multi-threaded applications, {eid: 84925135842}>, <A unified modeling framework for distributed resource allocation of general fork and join processing networks, {eid: 77954909384}>, <None, {eid: 84866896733}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2015-05-16,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-84964265469,True,False,True,False

Operators can configure, monitor, or control the industrial production process remotely via Internet, which brings security threats to IIoTs. Since the IIoT focuses on the availability of industrial production, it is unfeasible to study security issues directly on the industrial field. Thus, constructing an IIoT cyber range to reproduce industrial scenarios for offensive and defensive confrontation research is necessary. However, the traditional IIoT cyber range relies on physical industrial field devices that are not reproducible and hard to recover from cyber-attacks. To solve these problems, in this article, we propose a framework for a digital twin-based cyber range and a digital twin construction method with multiple models. Cyber ranges with digital twins are more flexible and convenient. Based on the proposed method, an industrial scenario is reproduced using machine learning algorithms to predict temperature changes from different perspectives. The experimental result shows the ability of digital twins to construct an IIoT cyber range to reproduce production processes and replace field devices.",,,,,,,,,"<Multiclass routing and medium access control for heterogeneous mobile ad hoc networks, {eid: 32144440632, doi: 10.1109/TVT.2005.861183}>, <Stuxnet: Dissecting a cyberwarfare weapon, {eid: 79957616447, doi: 10.1109/MSP.2011.67}>, <Deep reinforcement learning for partially observable data poisoning attack in crowdsensing systems, {eid: 85089308646, doi: 10.1109/JIOT.2019.2962914}>, <Deepgreen: A dispersed energy-efficiency computing paradigm for green industrial IoT, {eid: 85102645232, doi: 10.1109/TGCN.2021.3064683}>, <Digital twin shop-floor: A new shop-floor paradigm towards smart manufacturing, {eid: 85030752762, doi: 10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2756069}>, <Digital twin: Mitigating unpredictable, undesirable emergent behavior in complex systems, {eid: 85006339863, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-38756-7-4}>, <An application framework of digital twin and its case study, {eid: 85049576881, doi: 10.1007/s12652-018-0911-3}>, <Plug-and-simulate within modular assembly line enabled by digital twins and the use of AutomationML, {eid: 85044297204, doi: 10.1016/j.ifacol.2017.08.2360}>, <A methodology for digital twinmodeling and deployment for industry 4.0, {eid: 85098780861, doi: 10.1109/JPROC.2020.3032444}>, <Machine learning based digital twin framework for production optimization in petrochemical industry, {eid: 85066307148, doi: 10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2019.05.020}>, <Cyber-physical security testbeds: Architecture, application, and evaluation for smart grid, {eid: 84878309013, doi: 10.1109/TSG.2012.2226919}>, <EPIC: A testbed for scientifically rigorous cyber-physical security experimentation, {eid: 84913609374, doi: 10.1109/TETC.2013.2287188}>, <CyberFactory# 1-Securing the industry 4.0 with cyber-ranges and digital twins, {eid: 85050025311, doi: 10.1109/WFCS.2018.8402377}>, <A digital twin-based cyber range for SOC analysts, {eid: 85112735183, doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-81242-3-17}>, <MiniCPS: A toolkit for security research on CPS networks, {eid: 84964840467, doi: 10.1145/2808705.2808715}>, <Automated attack and defense framework toward 5G security, {eid: 85084212972, doi: 10.1109/MNET.011.1900635}>, <OpenFlow: Enabling innovation in campus networks, {eid: 68649129121, doi: 10.1145/1355734.1355746}>, <OpenPLC: An open-source alternative to automation, {eid: 84936803658, doi: 10.1109/GHTC.2014.6970342}>, <Honeypot identification in softwarized industrial cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85098799112, doi: 10.1109/TII.2020.3044576}>, <Condition assessment, remaining useful life prediction and life extension decision making for offshore oil and gas assets, {eid: 85019130329, doi: 10.1016/j.jlp.2017.04.030}>, <Energy-efficient and traffic-aware service function chaining orchestration in multi-domain networks, {eid: 85053801008, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2018.09.037}>, <The connotation of digital twin, and the construction and applicationmethod of shop-floor digital twin, {eid: 85094857400, doi: 10.1016/j.rcim.2020.102075}>, <An approach to develop a digital twin for industry 4.0 systems: Manufacturing automation case studies, {eid: 85109762696, doi: 10.1080/0951192X.2021.1946857}>, <LightGBM: A highly efficient gradient boosting decision tree, {eid: 85055954505, doi: 10.5555/3294996.3295074}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-11-01,,,,,,,eng,,Trade Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85137911695,False,False,True,False

In practice, real-world applications generate huge volumes of data at speeds. These data streams require analysis and preprocessing before being permanently stored or used in a learning task. Therefore, significant attention has been paid to the systematic management and construction of high-quality datasets. Nevertheless, managing voluminous and high-velocity data streams is usually performed manually (i.e. offline), making it an impractical strategy in production environments. To address this challenge, DataOps has emerged to achieve life-cycle automation of data processes using DevOps principles. However, determining the data quality based on a fitness scale constitutes a complex task within the framework of DataOps. This paper presents a novel Data Quality Scoring Operations (DQSOps) framework that yields a quality score for production data in DataOps workflows. The framework incorporates two scoring approaches, an ML prediction-based approach that predicts the data quality score and a standard-based approach that periodically produces the ground-truth scores based on assessing several data quality dimensions. We deploy the DQSOps framework in a real-world industrial use case. The results show that DQSOps achieves significant computational speedup rates compared to the conventional approach of data quality scoring while maintaining high prediction performance.","Automated data scoring, data assessment, data quality dimensions, DataOps, mutation testing",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 77957553895}>, <None, {eid: 85133932274}>, <2011.

For example, this applies when new data versions arise from either a generated or aggregated extension of an existing dataset a model has already been trained on. In this work, it is investigated on how a model-based approach for these training data concerns can be provided as well as how the complete process, including the resulting training and retraining process of the ML model, can therein be integrated. Hence, model-based concepts and the implementation are devised to cope with the complexity of iterative data management as an enabler for the integration of continuous retraining routines. With Deep Learning techniques becoming technically feasible and massively being developed further over the last decade, MLOps, aiming to establish DevOps tailored to ML projects, gained crucial relevance. Unfortunately, data-management concepts for iteratively growing datasets with retraining capabilities embedded in a model-driven ML development methodology are unexplored to the best of our knowledge. To fill in this gap, this contribution provides such agile data management concepts and integrates them and continuous retraining into the model-driven ML Framework MontiAnna [18]. The new functionality is evaluated in the context of a research project where ML is exploited for the optimal design of lattice structures for crash applications.","artificial intelligence, data management, model-driven engineering, retraining",,,,,,,,"<Data platform for machine learning, {eid: 85069440635}>, <None, {eid: 85102105267}>, <Software Engineering for Machine Learning: A Case Study, {eid: 85072111655}>, <Artifact and Reference Models for Generative Machine Learning Frameworks and Build Systems, {eid: 85120851738}>, <On the Co-evolution of ML Pipelines and Source Code-Empirical Study of DVC Projects, {eid: 85106644733}>, <Machine learning and semantic sentiment analysis based algorithms for suicide sentiment prediction in social networks, {eid: 85033461596}>, <Data management in machine learning systems, {eid: 85082126207}>, <Managing larger data on a github repository, {eid: 85099571714}>, <Machine learning in finance: The case of deep learning for option pricing, {eid: 85066331914}>, <An overview of the HDF5 technology suite and its applications, {eid: 79956025832}>, <Modeling Deep Reinforcement Learning Based Architectures for Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85075937600}>, <Memory or time: Performance evaluation for iterative operation on hadoop and spark, {eid: 84903975456}>, <Getting Data into Databricks, {eid: 85142923630}>, <Overview and importance of data quality for machine learning tasks, {eid: 85090410666}>, <Modeling Dynamic Architectures of Self-Adaptive Cooperative Systems, {eid: 85075948566}>, <Hierarchical data format 5: HDF5, {eid: 83955161960}>, <MontiCore: A Framework for Compositional Development of Domain Specific Languages, {eid: 77955230740}>, <Modeling and Training of Neural Processing Systems, {eid: 85075936455}>, <Modeling and Training of Neural Processing Systems, {eid: 85075936455}>, <Highly-Optimizing and Multi-Target Compiler for Embedded System Models: C++ Compiler Toolchain for the Component and Connector Language EmbeddedMontiArc, {eid: 85056871758}>, <Learning without forgetting, {eid: 85035137409}>, <Learning under concept drift: A review, {eid: 85055030391}>, <A survey of big data architectures and machine learning algorithms in healthcare, {eid: 85032987630}>, <Big data analysis using Apache Hadoop, {eid: 84891103002}>, <Crashworthiness optimization of combined straight-Tapered tubes using genetic algorithm and neural networks, {eid: 85042259603}>, <Data management challenges in production machine learning, {eid: 85021190615}>, <Data lifecycle challenges in production machine learning: A survey, {eid: 85058810729}>, <Demystifying MLOps and Presenting a Recipe for the Selection of Open-Source Tools, {eid: 85115788129}>, <Accelerating the machine learning lifecycle with MLflow, {eid: 85072938346}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2022-10-23,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85142938377,True,True,True,False

After deployment, these models can be utilised in a Digital Twin setting, acting as virtual replicas of the physical components and reflecting the behaviour of the running system in real-time. Complex systems often consist of numerous models interacting with each other and individual models may need to be updated after deployment. This means that new models need to be integrated and swapped during runtime without interrupting the running system. In this paper, we propose an approach for model-based Digital Twins to replace individual models without stopping or halting the operation of a cyber-physical system. Furthermore, our approach allows to replace not only individual models, but also update the overall structure of the interaction of models in the Digital Twin setting. The use of the proposed mechanism is illustrated through two case-studies with an agricultural robot prototype.","Co-simulation, Digital Twins, Functional Mock-up Interface, Model Swap, Model-driven engineering",,,,,,,,"<A survey of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84555177840}>, <Cyber-physical systems: challenge of the 21st century, {eid: 84994378262}>, <A model-based design methodology for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 80052469409}>, <A comprehensive survey on modeling of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85055255781}>, <Integrated Tool Chain for Model-Based Design of Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85006151292}>, <Co-simulation: a Survey, {eid: 85051436184}>, <Product lifecycle management: the new paradigm for enterprises, {eid: 34047222275}>, <Multi-modelling and co-simulation in the engineering of cyber-physical systems: Towards the digital twin, {eid: 85073679094}>, <Characterising the digital twin: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85081219520}>, <Towards modular digital twins of robot systems, {eid: 85143058136}>, <Recent developments in hardware-in-the-loop testing, {eid: 85061083191}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <Functional Mockup Interface 2.0: The Standard for Tool independent Exchange of Simulation Models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <The fmi 3.0 standard interface for clocked and scheduled simulations, {eid: 85124046429}>, <Towards reuse of synchronization algorithms in co-simulation frameworks, {eid: 85091582766}>, <An fmi-based initialization plugin for into-cps maestro 2, {eid: 85101498944}>, <None, {eid: 84928170648}>, <The FMI 3.0 Standard Interface for Clocked and Scheduled Simulations, {eid: 85124046429}>, <Master for co-simulation using FMI, {eid: 84908292404}>, <Formally verified fmi enabled external data broker: Rabbitmq fmu, {eid: 85099278177}>, <Rmqfmu: Bridging the real world with co-simulation for practitioners, {eid: 85146053605}>, <Design Space Exploration in the Development of Agricultural Robots, {eid: 85073686308}>, <Addressing time discrepancy between digital and physical twins, {eid: 85146053531}>, <Assured and correct dynamic update of controllers, {eid: 84974593757}>, <Model-driven engineering tools and languages for cyber-physical systems–a systematic literature review, {eid: 85103282925}>, <The disappearing boundary between development-time and run-time, {eid: 79951591300}>, <Dynamic software updating: a systematic mapping study, {eid: 85092103229}>, <Towards a model-based devops for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85096956543}>, <Twinops -

Two possible paths to improve the management of machine learning assets include 1) Adopting dedicated machine-learning experiment management tools, which are gaining popularity for supporting concerns such as versioning, traceability, auditability, collaboration, and reproducibility; 2) Developing new and improved version control tools with support for domain-specific operations tailored to machine learning assets. As a contribution to improving asset management on both paths, this work presents Experiment Management Meta-Model (EMMM), a meta-model that unifies the conceptual structures and relationships extracted from systematically selected machine-learning experiment management tools. We explain the metamodel’s concepts and relationships and evaluate it using real experiment data. The proposed meta-model is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) with its meta-modeling language, Ecore, to encode model structures. Our meta-model can be used as a concrete blueprint for practitioners and researchers to improve existing tools and develop new tools with native support for machine-learning-specific assets and operations.","Machine learning experiments, Management tools, MDE, Metamodeling",,,,,,,,"<Survey of machine-learning experimental methods at neurips2019 and iclr2020, {eid: 85094777862}>, <None, {eid: 85083077693}>, <Project repositories for machine learning with tensorflow, {eid: 85086630438}>, <Trials and tribulations of developers of intelligent systems: A field study, {eid: 85000434626}>, <Software Engineering Challenges of Deep Learning, {eid: 85057169222}>, <Sofware engineering challenges for machine learning applications: A literature review, {eid: 85102661501}>, <Asset management in machine learning: A survey, {eid: 85109085275}>, <None, {eid: 85138404749}>, <None, {eid: 85147684797}>, <Traceability for trustworthy ai: A review of models and tools, {eid: 85106151024}>, <Implicit Provenance for Machine Learning Artifacts, {eid: 85091940314}>, <A Survey of Software Development Process Models in Software Engineering, {eid: 84949498241}>, <CRISP-DM: Towards a Standard Process Model for Data Mining, {eid: 0003157840}>, <The KDD Process for Extracting Useful Knowledge from Volumes of Data, {eid: 0030285403}>, <Machine learning for networking: Workflow, advances and opportunities, {eid: 85036566955}>, <None, {eid: 85136041419}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <Adoption and effects of software engineering best practices in machine learning, {eid: 85095814265}>, <Out-of-the-Box Reproducibility: A Survey of Machine Learning Platforms, {eid: 85083260307}>, <Deep-water framework: The Swiss army knife of humans working with machine learning models, {eid: 85086427001}>, <Mapping platforms into a new open science model for machine learning, {eid: 85075184361}>, <On the Need for Artifact Models in, {eid: 85042655599}>, <None, {eid: 85147701586}>, <Artifact and reference models for generative machine learning frameworks and build systems, {eid: 85120851738}>, <Artifact-Based Analysis for the Development of Collaborative Embedded Systems, {eid: 85108965376}>, <None, {eid: 85095253828}>, <Machine learning pipelines: Provenance, reproducibility and fair data principles, {eid: 85147688840}>, <Cross-validation, {eid: 79954553074}>, <A Practical Taxonomy of Reproducibility for Machine Learning Research, {eid: 85080704884}>, <ModelDB: a system for machine learning model management, {eid: 84979752252}>, <Evaluating classification schema and classification decisions, {eid: 85050828867}>, <Toward methodological guidelines for process theories and taxonomies in software engineering, {eid: 85040976130}>, <On the effectiveness of machine learning experiment management tools, {eid: 85132832571}>, <Asset management in machine learning: State-of-research and state-of-practice, {eid: 85147701250}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-08-31,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85146495066,False,False,True,True

Since SIS typically operate in a changing and often unpredictable environment, the ability of these systems to continuously evolve and adapt to their new environment is decisive to ensure and increase their trustworthiness, quality and user experience. The DevOps movement advocates a set of software engineering best practices and tools, to ensure Quality of Service whilst continuously evolving complex systems.

Manual analysis of such models is challenging and error-prone due to sheer size. To help in this task, automated analysis of feature models (AAFM) has emerged over the past three decades. However, the diversity of these tools and their supported languages presents a significant challenge that motivated the MOD-EVAR community to initiate a project for a new tool that supports the UVL language. Despite the rise of machine learning and data science, along with robust Python-based libraries, most AAFM tools have been implemented in Java, creating a collaboration gap. This paper introduces Flama, an innovative framework that automates the analysis of variability models. It focuses on UVL model analysis and aims for easy integration and extensibility to bridge this gap and foster better community and cross-community collaboration.","data visualization, effective communication, graphs and tables, software product line, variability, visualization design process",,,,,,,,"<Familiar: A domain-specific language for large scale management of feature models, {eid: 84875729938}>, <Clafer: unifying class and feature modeling, {eid: 84917709136}>, <Automated analysis of feature models 20 years later: A literature review, {eid: 77955227439}>, <Fama, {eid: 84932635887}>, <API documentation, {eid: 85159783498}>, <Debian Packages Repositories as Software Product Line Models, {eid: 84871305316}>, <Automated analysis of feature models: Quo vadis?, {eid: 85051563856}>, <Uniform and scalable sampling of highly configurable systems, {eid: 85123378721}>, <FM fact label: a configurable and interactive visualization of feature model characterizations, {eid: 85139172754}>, <Empirical analysis of the tool support for software product lines, {eid: 85131551970}>, <FeatureIDE: A tool framework for featureoriented software development, {eid: 70349553079}>, <Advisory: vulnerability analysis in software development project dependencies, {eid: 85139148412}>, <Early Definition of Frozen and Hot Spots in the Development of Domain Frameworks, {eid: 85175978948}>, <An overview on analysis tools for software product lines, {eid: 84907809917}>, <CNF Encodings, {eid: 72949099058}>, <Selection of software product line implementation components using recommender systems: An application to wordpress, {eid: 85067252529}>, <BeTTy: benchmarking and testing on the automated analysis of feature models, {eid: 84857593568}>, <The Variability Model of The Linux Kernel, {eid: 78049370236}>, <PEP 8-style guide for python code, {eid: 84887076248}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2023-08-28,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85168118717,False,True,True,False

Unsurprisingly, Machine Learning (ML) applications in AM technologies have been increasingly growing in the past several years. The trend is driven by the ability of data-driven techniques to support a range of AM concerns, including in-process monitoring and predictions. However, despite numerous ML applications being reported for different AM concerns, no framework exists to systematically manage these ML models for AM operations in the industry. Moreover, no guidance exists on fundamental requirements to realize such a cross-disciplinary platform. Working with experts in ML and AM, this work identifies the fundamental requirements to realize a Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) platform to support process-based ML models for industrial metal AM (MAM). Project-level activities are identified in terms of functional roles, processes, systems, operations, and interfaces. These components are discussed in detail and are linked with their respective requirements. In this regard, peer-reviewed references to identified requirements are made available. The requirements identified can help guide small and medium enterprises looking to implement ML solutions for AM in the industry. Challenges and opportunities for such a system are highlighted. The system can be expanded to include other lifecycle phases of metallic and non-metallic AM.","Computing infrastructure, Data analytics and machine learning, Fundamental and functional requirements,

MDD is particularly useful in the engineering of complex, possibly distributed software systems. It is therefore sensible to investigate the adoption of MDD to support and facilitate the engineering of distributed software systems based on microservice architecture (MSA). This chapter presents recent insights from studying and developing two approaches for employing MDD in MSA engineering. The first approach uses a graphical notation to model the topology and interactions of MSA-based software systems. The second approach emerged from the first one and exploits viewpoint-based modeling to better cope with MSA’s inherent complexity. It also considers the distributed nature of MSA teams, as well as the technology heterogeneity introduced by MSA adoption. Both approaches are illustrated and discussed in the context of a case study. Moreover, we present a catalog of research questions for subsequent investigation of employing MDD to support and facilitate MSA engineering.","Metamodeling, Microservice architecture, Model-driven development, Modeling languages, Software architecture, Software design",,,,,,,,"<Infrastructure-as-code for data-intensive architectures: A model-driven development approach, {eid: 85051103640}>, <Microservices architecture enables DevOps: Migration to a cloud-native architecture, {eid: 84968796741}>, <None, {eid: 0004025223}>, <Towards integrating microservices with adaptable enterprise architecture, {eid: 84992626303}>, <Microservices in industry: Insights into technologies, characteristics, and software quality, {eid: 85066486037}>, <None, {eid: 85023646999}>, <None, {eid: 85054938535}>, <Model-driven generation of microservice architectures for benchmarking performance and resilience engineering approaches, {eid: 85019479213}>, <None, {eid: 4644300495}>, <None, {eid: 2942742234}>, <Model-driven development of complex software: A research roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <Collaborative model-driven software engineering: A classification framework and a research map, {eid: 85030632465}>, <Classification of concrete textual syntax mapping approaches, {eid: 70349852882}>, <None, {eid: 0003518498}>, <Towards recovering the software architecture of microservice-based systems, {eid: 85025689600}>, <The hidden dividends of microservices, {eid: 84976307780}>, <Investigation of impacts on network performance in the advance of a microservice design, {eid: 85024389666}>, <Model transformation intents and their properties, {eid: 84904275821}>, <Models in software engineering-an introduction, {eid: 14244260708}>, <Comparison of a textual versus a graphical notation for the maintainability of MDE domain models: An empirical pilot study, {eid: 84949748738}>, <None, {eid: 84908871569}>, <None, {eid: 85010410859}>, <None, {eid: 84950338538}>, <None, {eid: 84870676587}>, <None, {eid: 0013137299}>, <None, {eid: 84886743417}>, <None, {eid: 85118523856}>, <Why looking isn’t always seeing: Readership skills and graphical programming, {eid: 0029327901}>, <Challenges of domain-driven microservice design: A model-driven perspective, {eid: 85046890847}>, <Microservice architecture and model-driven development: Yet singles, soon married (?), {eid: 85058570602}>, <Aspect-oriented modeling of technology heterogeneity in microservice architecture, {eid: 85065789976}>, <A model-driven workflow for distributed microservice development, {eid: 85065640931}>, <Viewpoint-specific model-driven microservice development with interlinked modeling languages, {eid: 85065782256}>, <None, {eid: 85010958676}>, <All the services large and micro: Revisiting industrial practice in services computing, {eid: 84964803678}>, <Ajil: Enabling model-driven microservice development, {eid: 85055702323}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <On the definition of microservice bad smells, {eid: 85046708734}>, <None, {eid: 85044973439}>, <The state of practice in model-driven engineering, {eid: 84899687758}>",,,Springer International Publishing,,,2019-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Book,,,,2-s2.0-85086303989,True,True,True,True

They are formulated as a network of interacting cyberspace and physical elements. Dealing with this new industrial context, distributed control systems (DCS) are increasingly involved because they permit meeting flexibility and adaptability requirements, which can give scope to CPS. The product driven control system (PDS) is considered as DCS in which the product plays a major role in decision-making. However, the PDS paradigm has not yet received sufficient attention within the CPS. Relying on multi-agents system as implementation framework, radio frequency identity as auto-identity technologies, and hardware in the loop simulation as a practical methodology, the paper proposes a validation and practical framework of PDS applied to the highly automated flexible robotized assembly system. An efficient CPS is developed for a discrete flexible manufacturing system.","Cyber-physical systems, Distributed control system, Hardware in the loop simulation, Multi-agents system, Product driven

Publication rights licensed to ACM.Component and Connector (C&C) models, with their corresponding code generators, are widely used by large automotive manufacturers to develop new software functions for embedded systems interacting with their environment; C&C example applications are engine control, remote parking pilots, and traffic sign assistance. This paper presents a complete toolchain to design and compile C&C models to highly-optimized code running on multiple targets including x86/x64, ARM and WebAssembly. One of our contributions are algebraic and threading optimizations to increase execution speed for computationally expensive tasks. A further contribution is an extensive case study with over 50 experiments. This case study compares the runtime speed of the generated code using different compilers and mathematical libraries. These experiments showed that programs produced by our compiler are at least two times faster than the ones compiled by MATLAB/Simulink for machine learning applications such as image clustering for object detection. Additionally, our compiler toolchain provides a complete model-based testing framework and plug-in points for middleware integration. We make all materials including models and toolchains electronically available for inspection and further research.","Code generation, Model-driven software engineering",,,,,,,,"<A decade of agile methodologies: Towards explaining agile software development, {eid: 84859527852}>, <Accurate real-time relative localization using single-frequency GPS, {eid: 84914155190}>, <None, {eid: 85056908316}>, <None, {eid: 0003761296}>, <An open source modelica graphic editor integrated with electronic notebooks and interactive simulation, {eid: 84861903229}>, <None, {eid: 85056824435}>, <An Open Continuous Deployment Infrastructure for a Self-driving Vehicle Ecosystem, {eid: 84971500502}>, <Component and connector views in practice: An experience report, {eid: 85040631558}>, <None, {eid: 85056841349}>, <None, {eid: 85056814209}>, <None, {eid: 85056883752}>, <None, {eid: 84899089919}>, <None, {eid: 85020420641}>, <None, {eid: 85056834473}>, <OpenModelica-A free open-source environment for system modeling, simulation, and teaching, {eid: 43049176427}>, <Simulation framework for executing component and connector models of self-driving vehicles, {eid: 85041433031}>, <Engineering tagging languages for DSLs, {eid: 84961634193}>, <None, {eid: 85056851283}>, <Model-Based Development of Self-Adaptive Autonomous Vehicles using the SMARDT Methodology, {eid: 85052024078}>, <Lead system transformation for pooling of body surface map data: A surface Laplacian approach, {eid: 0028820812}>, <None, {eid: 0004193224}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <None, {eid: 85056850193}>, <None, {eid: 33646566908}>, <None, {eid: 77952650268}>, <Hyperthreading technology in the netburst microarchitecture, {eid: 0038633602}>, <Modeling architectures of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85025124378}>, <LLVM: A compilation framework for lifelong program analysis & transformation, {eid: 3042658703}>, <None, {eid: 85056884212}>, <The inverse of a tridiagonal matrix, {eid: 0035631290}>, <Consistent extra-functional properties tagging for component and connector models, {eid: 85025163766}>, <None, {eid: 85056822022}>, <None, {eid: 85056851928}>, <None, {eid: 85056861453}>, <None, {eid: 85056861453}>, <None, {eid: 85056824273}>, <None, {eid: 85056811269}>, <None, {eid: 85056813951}>, <None, {eid: 85056815825}>, <None, {eid: 85056904808}>, <On spectral clustering: Analysis and an algorithm, {eid: 84899013108}>, <ROS: An open-source Robot Operating System, {eid: 77957352104}>, <None, {eid: 85056817186}>, <Armadillo: A template-based C++ library for linear algebra, {eid: 85017260755}>, <A survey of Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 84555177840}>, <None, {eid: 85033687701}>, <None, {eid: 4043148124}>, <None, {eid: 85034754239}>, <A tutorial on spectral clustering, {eid: 34548583274}>, <None, {eid: 85056874045}>, <None, {eid: 85056810104}>, <None, {eid: 85056810104}>, <Intel math kernel library, {eid: 84945118616}>, <None, {eid: 85056807163}>, <None, {eid: 84947908098}>, <Emscripten: An LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler, {eid: 81355123361}>, <Test-driven modeling for model-driven development, {eid: 4644363382}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2018-10-14,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85056871758,True,False,True,False

Many software applications are being submitted to a process of migration from its monolithic architecture to a more modular, scalable and flexible architecture of microservices. This process is slow and, depending on the project's complexity, it may take months or even years to complete. This paper proposes a new approach on microservice identification by resorting to topic modelling in order to identify services according to domain terms. This approach in combination with clustering techniques produces a set of services based on the original software. The proposed methodology is implemented as an open-source tool for exploration of monolithic architectures and identification of microservices. A quantitative analysis using the state of the art metrics on independence of functionality and modularity of services was conducted on 200 open-source projects collected from GitHub. Cohesion at message and domain level metrics' showed medians of roughly 0.6. Interfaces per service exhibited a median of 1.5 with a compact interquartile range. Structural and conceptual modularity revealed medians of 0.2 and 0.4 respectively.

This increases agility and flexibility in continuous integration within limited resources. Consequently, interaction among reusable components results in mismatch of components specification and retrieval due to encapsulated functionalities. Therefore, most of the components-based software fail during integration testing. In this paper, we propose a framework for component based software specification and integration testing. The proposed framework considers multiple contexts for component specification and uses a data mining technique for improving the integration testing process. We evaluated the proposed framework using empirical study. The results show significant improvement for various parameters in the proposed framework as compared to traditional approaches of component based software development.","CBSE, components, generation, MBT, Sequence Diagram, test case, testing, UML",,,,,,,,"<A model-based testing technique for component-based real-time embedded systems, {eid: 84934300238}>, <A proposal for new software testing technique for component based software system, {eid: 85046336643}>, <Software paradigms, assessment types and non-functional requirements in model-based integration testing: A systematic literature review, {eid: 84905489438}>, <The AGEDIS tools for model-based testing, {eid: 23744455146}>, <A UML-based approach to system testing, {eid: 4344612500}>, <Automatic test generation: A use case driven approach, {eid: 33645820260}>, <Functional test case generation based on model driven testing using FSM and UML activity diagram, {eid: 85053265336}>, <A picture from the model-based testing area: Concepts, techniques, and challenges, {eid: 80052143861}>, <A model-based trace testing approach for validation of formal co-simulation models, {eid: 84928102507}>, <A UML-based approach to system testing, {eid: 4344612500}>, <Automated transition from use cases to UML state machines to support state-based testing, {eid: 79959243446}>, <Facilitating the transition from use case models to analysis models: Approach and experiments, {eid: 84874828402}>, <Automatic generation of system test cases from use case specifications, {eid: 84975763819}>, <A model-based trace testing approach for validation of formal co-simulation models, {eid: 84928102507}>, <A model-based test case generation method for function testing of Train Control Systems, {eid: 84995477028}>, <Towards an integrated approach to verification and model-based testing in system engineering, {eid: 85041811373}>, <An approach to generate test cases from sequence diagram, {eid: 84918590141}>, <Towards model-based integration of component-based automotive software systems, {eid: 85046253871}>, <An empirical study on the effect of testing on code quality using topic models: A case study on software development systems, {eid: 85023162278}>, <Comparing LDA and LSA topic models for content-based movie recommendation systems, {eid: 84952670175}>, <Stability of topic modeling via matrix factorization, {eid: 85028880663}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2018-11-24,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85062789555,False,True,True,False

This work shows how the scalability and accuracy of the data mining process can be dramatically improved by using information from data/control flow analysis to reduce the search space of the invariant mining and to eliminate false positives. Comparative evaluations of the process show that the improvements significantly reduce execution time and memory consumption, thereby supporting the analysis of more complex models, while also improving the accuracy of the generated invariants.","Automated test generation, Invariant mining, Model-based development, Verification and validation",,,,,,,,"<Automatic requirement extraction from test cases, {eid: 78650130252}>, <Semantic translation of simulink/stateflow models to hybrid automata using graph transformations, {eid: 10444269559}>, <Mining association rules between sets of items in large databases, {eid: 0027621699}>, <On the complexity of mining association rules, {eid: 3142659104}>, <Mining temporal invariants from partially ordered logs, {eid: 81055155516}>, <Simulation-directed invariant mining for software verification, {eid: 49749119976}>, <None, {eid: 84963820509}>, <The daikon system for dynamic detection of likely invariants, {eid: 35348872682}>, <None, {eid: 85030694687}>, <The SPMF open-source data mining library version 2, {eid: 84988603099}>, <Artshop: A continuous integration and quality assessment framework for model-based software artifacts, {eid: 84996742929}>, <Similarity measures in scientometric research: The jaccard index versus saltons cosine formula, {eid: 0024904643}>, <Mining frequent patterns without candidate generation, {eid: 0039253846}>, <Real-time heart model for implantable cardiac device validation and verification, {eid: 77958454649}>, <Modular code generation from synchronous block diagrams: Modularity vs. Code size, {eid: 67649868329}>, <Modular code generation fromtriggered and timed block diagrams, {eid: 51249100059}>, <Modularity vs. Reusability: Code generation fromsynchronous block diagrams, {eid: 49749123427}>, <Tool for translating simulink models into input language of a model checker, {eid: 33845247797}>, <Exploratory mining and pruning optimizations of constrained associations rules, {eid: 0032092760}>, <A toolset for simulink: Improving software engineering practices in development with simulink, {eid: 84939537353}>, <Mining frequent itemsets with convertible constraints, {eid: 0035016447}>, <GoldMine: Automatic assertion generation using data mining and static analysis, {eid: 77953089806}>, <None, {eid: 0003639957}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2017-09-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85030672741,True,False,True,False

There are already approaches that provide an automatic repair of models, however, the same issues might not have the same solutions in all contexts due to different user preferences and business policies. Personalization would enhance the usability of automatic repairs in different contexts, and by reusing the experience from previous repairs we would avoid duplicated calculations when facing similar issues. By using reinforcement learning we have achieved the repair of broken models allowing both automation and personalization of results. In this paper, we propose transfer learning to reuse the experience learned from each model repair.

In the AIDOaRt research project, practitioners and researchers collaborate on AI-Augmented automation supporting modeling, coding, testing, monitoring, and continuous development in cyber-physical systems. The project specifically lies at the intersection of industry and academia collaboration with several industrial use cases. Through a process of elicitation and refinement, 78 high-level requirements were defined, and generalized into 30 generic requirements by the AIDOaRt partners. The main contribution of this paper is the set of generic requirements from the project for enhancing the development of cyber-physical systems with artificial intelligence, DevOps, and model-driven engineering, identifying the hot spots of industry needs in the interactions of MDE and AI.

In this paper, we outline a novel approach that treats system infrastructure as explicit runtime models. A key benefit of using such models@run.time representation is that it provides a uniform semantic foundation for resources monitoring and reconfiguration. Adopting models at runtime allows one to integrate different aspects of system management, such as resource monitoring and subsequent verification into an unified view which would otherwise have to be done manually and require to use different tools.

Family-based behavioral modeling paves the way for efficient model-based analysis of software product lines. Family-based behavioral model learning incorporates feature model analysis and model learning principles to efficiently unify product models into a family model and integrate the behavior of various products into a behavioral family model. Albeit reasonably effective, the exhaustive analysis of product lines is often infeasible due to the potentially exponential number of valid configurations. In this paper, we first present a family-based behavioral model learning techniques, called FFSMDiff. Subsequently, we report on our experience on learning family models by employing product sampling. Using 105 products of six product lines expressed in terms of Mealy machines, we evaluate the precision of family models learned from products selected from different settings of the T-wise product sampling criterion. We show that product sampling can lead to models as precise as those learned by exhaustive analysis and hence, reduce the costs for family model learning.","Family model, Model learning, Software product lines, T-wise sampling",,,,,,,,"<Automata learning through counterexample guided abstraction refinement, {eid: 84866000299}>, <Model learning and model-based testing, {eid: 85051109384}>, <Incling: Efficient product-line testing using incremental pairwise sampling, {eid: 85084189184}>, <Delta-oriented product prioritization for similarity-based product-line testing, {eid: 85027114086}>, <Matching UML class diagrams using a hybridized greedy-genetic algorithm, {eid: 85040780347}>, <Reverse engineering feature models from software configurations using formal concept analysis, {eid: 84961377139}>, <Learning regular sets from queries and counterexamples, {eid: 0023453626, doi: 10.1016/0890-5401(87)90052-6}>, <None, {eid: 84979494516}>, <Exploring feature interactions in the wild: The new feature-interaction challenge, {eid: 84890043412}>, <A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, {eid: 79959871222}>, <Formal description of variability in product families, {eid: 80054070983}>, <A compositional framework to derive product line behavioural descriptions, {eid: 84868275563}>, <Merging features in featured transition systems, {eid: 84960970353}>, <None, {eid: 51949106265}>, <Analyzing program behavior through active automata learning, {eid: 84906948261, doi: 10.1007/s10009-014-0333-2}>, <Automated analysis of feature models 20 years later: a literature review, {eid: 77955227439, doi: 10.1016/j.is.2010.01.001}>, <A survey on modeling techniques for formal behavioral verification of software product lines, {eid: 84961245105}>, <Input–output conformance testing for software product lines, {eid: 85008682089, doi: 10.1016/j.jlamp.2016.09.007}>, <Basic behavioral models for software product lines: expressiveness and testing pre-orders, {eid: 84937604468, doi: 10.1016/j.scico.2015.06.005}>, <A study of variability models and languages in the systems software domain, {eid: 84890065386, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2013.34}>, <Similarity testing for access control, {eid: 84914157978, doi: 10.1016/j.infsof.2014.07.003}>, <When 150 % is too much: Supporting product centric viewpoints in an industrial product line, {eid: 84991628008}>, <Intraprocedural dataflow analysis for software product lines, {eid: 84860443937}>, <Part i.

The platform consists of several inter-dependent components, most notably Service Studio, the Platform Server, and LifeTime. Service Studio is an integrated development environment used to create applications that are then compiled by the Platform Server. LifeTime is used to stage applications between different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). Our meta-model is versioned using a version number that we call Last Upgrade Version (LUV). Service Studio, the Platform Server, and the models they create/process are associated with a particular LUV. As a general rule, a platform component is only able to process models with the same LUV as the component itself. This approach is not very flexible: a change to the meta-model requires releasing a new set of platform components that our customers then need to install. Although there's low resistance to installing new versions of Service Studio, the same is not true for the Platform Server. Thus, for all practical purposes LUV changes are tied to releases of major versions of the OutSystems Platform. In this paper we share the techniques that allowed us to transition to a Continuous Delivery process in which our meta-model can evolve freely with no impact on our installed base.","Continuous delivery, Meta-model evolution, Model driven development, Model evolution",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85096742698}>, <Approaches to co-evolution of metamodels and models: A survey, {eid: 85021770842}>, <None, {eid: 84956534232}>, <Metamodel-specific coupled evolution based ondynamically typed graph transformations, {eid: 84884323976}>, <Truechange (tm) under the hood: How we check the consistency of large models (almost) instantly, {eid: 85075948222}>, <Graph transformation concepts for meta-model evolution guaranteeing permanent type conformance throughout model migration, {eid: 84867880463}>, <None, {eid: 85080499649}>, <None, {eid: 85096618284}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2020-10-16,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096761857,True,False,False,False

TCP approaches based on failure history have been adopted in this context because they are more suitable for CI environment constraints: test budget and test case volatility, that is, test cases may be added or removed over the CI cycles. Promising approaches are based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which learns with past prioritization, guided by a reward function. In this work, we introduce a TCP approach for CI environments based on the sliding window method, which can be instantiated with different Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Unlike other ML approaches, it does not require retraining the model to perform the prioritization and any code analysis. As an alternative for the RL approaches, we apply the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning network in our evaluation. We use three time budgets and eleven systems. The results show the applicability of the approach considering the prioritization time and the time between the CI cycles. Both algorithms take just a few seconds to execute. The RF algorithm obtained the best performance for more restrictive budgets compared to the RL approaches described in the literature. Considering all systems and budgets, RF reaches Normalized Average Percentage of Faults Detected (NAPFD) values that are the best or statistically equivalent to the best ones in around 72% of the cases, and the LSTM network in 55% of them. Moreover, we discuss some implications of our results for the usage of the algorithms evaluated.","Continuous Integration, Machine Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks, Regression Testing",,,,,,,,"<Continuous software engineering: A roadmap and agenda, {eid: 84937109068}>, <Test case prioritization in continuous integration environments: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85078708254}>, <Regression Testing Minimization, Selection and Prioritization: A Survey, {eid: 84857550008}>, <Techniques for Improving Regression Testing in Continuous Integration Development Environments, {eid: 84986877429}>, <Comparing White-box and Black-box Test Prioritization, {eid: 84971425590}>, <Learning-to-rank vs ranking-to-1earn: Strategies for regression testing in continuous integration, {eid: 85094318353}>, <Reinforcement Learning for Automatic Test Case Prioritization and Selection in Continuous Integration, {eid: 85026639599}>, <A multi-armed bandit approach for test case prioritization in continuous integration environments, {eid: 85095865061}>, <Machine learning for sequential data: A review, {eid: 84951778046}>, <Some aspects of the sequential design of experiments, {eid: 84966203785}>, <Random forests, {eid: 0035478854}>, <Long short-term memory, {eid: 0031573117}>, <Combinatorial Interaction Regression Testing: A Study of Test Case Generation and Prioritization, {eid: 47349111813}>, <None, {eid: 85135851250}>, <Test Case Prioritizationfor Continuous Regression Testing: An Industrial Case Study, {eid: 84891715780}>, <Multi-perspective Regression Test Prioritization for Time-Constrained Environments, {eid: 84962091042}>, <TITAN: Test Suite Optimization for Highly Configurable Software, {eid: 85020723577}>, <A learning algorithm for optimizing continuous integration development and testing practice, {eid: 85056634616}>, <Test case prioritization and selection technique in continuous integration development environments: A case study, {eid: 85047379940}>, <Test prioritization in continuous integration environments, {eid: 85053760573}>, <Learning for Test Prioritization: An Industrial Case Study, {eid: 84997235107}>, <None, {eid: 85061363347}>, <None, {eid: 85116290224}>, <None, {eid: 85104045394}>, <A framework for continuous regression and integration testing in loT systems based on deep learning and search-based techniques, {eid: 85097184092}>, <Clustering test cases in web application regression testing using se1forganizing maps, {eid: 84941274303}>, <LSTM-based deep learning for spatial-temporal software testing, {eid: 85084417507}>, <A survey on deep learning: Algorithms, techniques, and applications, {eid: 85053880872}>, <TERMINATOR: better automated ill test case prioritization, {eid: 85071929398}>, <None, {eid: 85135801841}>, <Test Case Prioritization: An Empirical Study, {eid: 0033326792}>, <Use of Ranks in One-Criterion Variance Analysis, {eid: 84943709252}>, <On a test of whether one of two random variables is stochastically larger than the other, {eid: 0002322469}>, <A comparison of alternative tests of significance for the problem of m rankings, {eid: 0001837148}>, <A Critique and Improvement of the CL Common Language Effect Size Statistics of McGraw and Wong, {eid: 0034411339}>, <None, {eid: 84944081816}>, <None, {eid: 84958264664}>, <None, {eid: 84971640658}>, <Scoot-learn: Machine learning in Python, {eid: 80555140075}>, <Geui: A federated testbed for innovative network experiments, {eid: 84897114787}>, <Robust prediction of fau1tproneness by random forests, {eid: 16244370106}>, <None, {eid: 85043308170}>, <None, {eid: 0003639957}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-03-15,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85135774956,False,False,True,True

We illustrate how two state-of-The-Art open-source modeling tools, namely MontiAnna and ML-Quadrat can be used for this purpose as demonstrated through a case study. The case study illustrates using ML, in particular deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), for automated image recognition of handwritten digits using the MNIST reference dataset, and integrating the machine learning components into an IoT-system. Subsequently, we conduct a functional comparison of the two frameworks, setting out an analysis base to include a broad range of design considerations, such as the problem domain, methods for the ML integration into larger systems, and supported ML methods, as well as topics of recent intense interest to the ML community, such as AutoML and MLOps. Accordingly, this paper is focused on elucidating the potential of the MDE approach in the ML domain. This supports the ML-engineer in developing the (ML/software) model rather than implementing the code, and additionally enforces reusability and modularity of the design through enabling the out-of-The-box integration of ML functionality as a component of the IoT or cyber-physical systems.","artificial intelligence, domain specific modeling, machine learning, model-driven engineering, tools",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84888639273}>, <Machine learning at Microsoft with ML.

These complex BDA applications require software design, development, and deployment strategies to deal with volume, velocity, and variety (3vs) while sustaining expected performance levels. BDA software complexity frequently leads to delayed deployments, longer development cycles and challenging performance monitoring. This paper proposes a DevOps and Domain Specific Model (DSM) approach to design, deploy, and monitor performance Quality Scenarios (QS) in BDA applications. This approach uses high-level abstractions to describe deployment strategies and QS enabling performance monitoring. Our experimentation compares the effort of development, deployment and QS monitoring of BDA applications with two use cases of near mid-air collisions (NMAC) detection. The use cases include different performance QS, processing models, and deployment strategies. Our results show shorter (re)deployment cycles and the fulfillment of latency and deadline QS for micro-batch and batch processing.","Big data analytics, DevOps, Domain specific model, Performance quality scenarios, Software architecture",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85057250097}>, <Infrastructure-as-code for data-intensive architectures: A model-driven development approach, {eid: 85051103640}>, <None, {eid: 0004025223}>, <None, {eid: 84943326563}>, <Executing architectural models for big data analytics, {eid: 85057231099}>, <Agile big data analytics forweb-based systems: An architecture-centric approach, {eid: 85014709685}>, <Adaptive application performance management for big data stream processing, {eid: 84964475332}>, <A performance modeling framework for lambda architecture based applications, {eid: 85026670445}>, <Towards a model-driven design tool for big data architectures, {eid: 84974539619}>, <Towards model based approach to hadoop deployment and configuration, {eid: 84964299938}>, <A family of well-clear boundary models for the integration of uas in the nas, {eid: 85085403874}>, <Streaming big data processing in datacenter clouds, {eid: 84961627543}>, <None, {eid: 33751002702}>, <Scheduling of big data applications on distributed cloud based on qos parameters, {eid: 84939980804}>, <None, {eid: 70349441583}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2019-09-09,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85081976722,False,True,True,False

Modeling and Simulation as a Service (MSaaS), as a new paradigm, supports sharing simulation models or modeling tools and has enabled a wide range of model reuse. However, reusing or combining some immature models may result in inefficient M&S activities or even false simulation results. To make sure the appropriate reuse and composition of simulation models in cloud environments, which is also termed as model service composition for simulation (MSCS), this paper incorporates model maturity with service cooperation as a metric to evaluate the quality of model composition in cloud. Then, as a multi-objective optimization problem with multiple constraints, the MSCS problem and its process are described in detail. To solve the MSCS problem, a novel evolutionary algorithm named CA-AO-NSGAII is proposed. In the algorithm, adaptive crossover and mutation operators, as well as probabilistic initialization are developed. Furthermore, a half-local search algorithm in an elitist mechanism is designed for efficient decision-making. To validate the performance of CA-AO-NSGAII, experiments with respect to four different cases are conducted. Results show that the proposed method for addressing MSCS issue is effective and feasible.","Cloud computing, Evolutionary algorithm, Model maturity, Model service composition for simulation (MSCS), Modeling and simulation (M&S), MSaaS",,,,,,,,"<DEVS/SOA: A cross-platform framework for net-centric modeling and simulation in DEVS unified process, {eid: 67650606762}>, <A DEVS Based Modelling and Methodology-COSIM, {eid: 84896873864}>, <A Survey and Preliminary Research on Service Federation Based Modeling and Simulation, {eid: 84962081992}>, <A review of Web-based simulation and supporting tools, {eid: 74449088143}>, <Networked Modeling & Simulation Platform Based on Concept of Cloud Computing Cloud Simulation Platform, {eid: 70349400264}>, <None, {eid: 85113278460}>, <Modeling and simulation as a cloud service: a survey, {eid: 84894157608}>, <SimSaaS: simulation software-as-a-service, {eid: 84896330895}>, <Model maturity towards modeling and simulation: Concepts, index system framework and evaluation method, {eid: 85086280964}>, <Optimal Operation of Active Distribution Grids: a System of Systems Framework, {eid: 84899961551}>, <Real-time load balancing scheduling algorithm for periodic simulation models, {eid: 85027930932}>, <A Practical Guide to SysML: The Systems Modeling Language.

In this paper, we claim that Model-Driven Engineering can facilitate DevOps for CPSs by automatically connecting a CPS design model to its runtime monitoring, in the form of a digital twin.","DevOps, digital twins, evolution of engineering models, model-based software engineering, models at runtime, self-adaptation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84943326563}>, <A cyber-physical systems architecture for industry 4.0-based manufacturing systems, {eid: 84921300723}>, <Conceptualizing digital twins, {eid: 85120045327}>, <Industry 4.0, {eid: 84926457128}>, <Digital twins for sustainable software systems, {eid: 85168134336}>, <None, {eid: 85161813629}>, <None, {eid: 85168144723}>, <None, {eid: 85092345471}>, <Environment, economy and society: Fitting them together into sustainable development, {eid: 0036856605}>, <None, {eid: 85023646999}>, <Models@run.time, {eid: 85008066028}>, <Models@run.time to support dynamic adaptation, {eid: 70350345225}>, <Model-driven Digital Twin Construction: Synthesizing the Integration of Cyber-Physical Systems with Their Information Systems, {eid: 85096992990}>, <A survey on engineering approaches for self-adaptive systems, {eid: 84924224388}>, <Toward self-healing infrastructure systems, {eid: 0342845322}>, <Towards a devops approach in cyber physical production systems using digital twins, {eid: 85096529757}>, <Process-Aware Digital Twin Cockpit Synthesis from Event Logs, {eid: 85131671533}>, <Requirements and design patterns for adaptive, autonomous, and context-aware digital twins in industry 4.0 digital factories, {eid: 85152477901}>, <Model-Driven Development of a Digital Twin for Injection Molding, {eid: 85086228557}>, <AML4DT: A model-driven framework for developing and maintaining digital twins with automationml, {eid: 85122957318}>, <CPSAML: A language and code generation framework for digital twin based monitoring of mobile cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85142923460}>, <Towards a Model-Driven Architecture for Interactive Digital Twin Cockpits, {eid: 85097375593}>, <Process Prediction with Digital Twins, {eid: 85121810059}>, <Systematic literature review of the objectives, techniques, kinds, and architectures of models at runtime, {eid: 84956643403}>, <MRUBiS: An exemplar for model-based architectural selfhealing and self-optimization, {eid: 85051484080}>, <Using trace alignments for measuring the similarity between a physical and its digital twin, {eid: 85142936475}>, <TwinOps-DevOps Meets Model-Based Engineering and Digital Twins for the Engineering of CPS, {eid: 85096747019}>, <Reactive Links across Multi-Domain Engineering Models, {eid: 85141855846}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-10-01,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85182393081,False,True,False,False

At the same time, this also introduced continuous delivery practices to the development of software components for network-connected gateways and sensing/actuating nodes. These devices are placed on end users’ premises and are characterized by continuously changing cyber-physical contexts, forcing software developers to maintain multiple application versions and frequently redeploy them on a distributed fleet of devices with respect to their current contexts. Doing this correctly and efficiently goes beyond manual capabilities and requires an intelligent and reliable automated solution. This paper describes a model-based approach to automatically assigning multiple software deployment plans to hundreds of edge gateways and connected IoT devices implemented in collaboration with a smart healthcare application provider. From a platform-specific model of an existing edge computing platform, we extract a platform-independent model that describes a list of target devices and a pool of available deployment plans. Next, we use constraint solving to automatically assign deployment plans to devices at once with respect to their specific contexts. The result is transformed back into the platform-specific model and includes a suitable deployment plan for each device, which is then consumed by our engine to deploy software components not only on edge gateways but also on their downstream IoT devices with constrained resources and connectivity. We validate the approach with a fleet deployment prototype integrated into a DevOps toolchain used by the partner application provider. Initial experiments demonstrate the viability of the approach and its usefulness in supporting DevOps for edge and IoT software development.","Constraint solving, Device fleet, DevOps, IoT,

As observed by some authors, the derivation of a product from product line shared core assets has been insufficiently addressed and can remain tedious in practice. We cope with this issue focusing on having a flexible and reactive model-based derivation, and propose an incremental evolution by extension of the product line coupled with this derivation activity. Process and tools bridge the gap between Application and Domain Engineering introducing a semi-automatic feedback to benefits from the developments made in the Application Engineering.

The proposed framework treats model abstractions of AI/ML models (named AI/ML Blueprints) as first-class citizens and promotes end-to-end transparency and portability from raw data detection- to model verification, and, policy-driven model management. This framework is grounded on the intelligent Application Architecture (iA2) and entails a first attempt to incorporate requirements stemming from (more) intelligent enterprise applications into a logically-structured architecture. The logical separation is grounded on the need to enact MLOps and logically separate basic data manipulation requirements (data-processing layer), from more advanced functionality needed to instrument applications with intelligence (data intelligence layer), and continuous deployment, testing and monitoring of intelligent application (knowledge-driven application layer).

However, inherent heterogeneity and complex implementation within these tools make it hard for DevOps users to design required resource-related artifacts. Currently, the defacto standard for cloud resource modeling and orchestration is TOSCA. Nonetheless, TOSCA is usually bound to TOSCA-compliant orchestration tools. Moreover, the actual integration between TOSCA and DevOps tools is still performed using costly coding and in ad-hoc manner. To resolve this, we believe that mapping and translation mechanisms between TOSCA and DevOps tools should be provided. In this paper, we propose a new model-driven approach for cloud resource orchestration. Our approach (i) adopts TOSCA to design resource-related artifacts regardless of a specific DevOps tool; (ii) enables a new model-driven translation technique that serves to translate the designed artifacts using TOSCA into DevOps specific artifacts and (iii) provides Connectors that intend to establish the bridge between DevOps-specific artifacts and the DevOps tools. Our approach provides a powerful enhancement to DevOps productivity and reusability by assisting toward a seamless integration between TOSCA and DevOps tools.","Artifact, MDE, Orchestration, TOSCA, Transformation",,,,,,,,"<A taxonomy and survey of cloud resource orchestration techniques, {eid: 85019878673}>, <Cloud resource orchestration programming: Overview, issues, and directions, {eid: 84941037480}>, <Declarative automated cloud resource orchestration, {eid: 82155203084}>, <None, {eid: 85072344652}>, <Cloud application portability with tosca, chef and open-stack, {eid: 84908602463}>, <Tosker: Orchestrating applications with tosca and docker, {eid: 85045248556}>, <None, {eid: 85072332301}>, <None, {eid: 85072334518}>, <None, {eid: 85072321693}>, <None, {eid: 85072323854}>, <Streamlining devops automation for cloud applications using tosca as standardized metamodel, {eid: 84958740530}>, <None, {eid: 85072340079}>, <From architecture modeling to application provisioning for the cloud by combining uml and tosca, {eid: 84979642473}>, <Survey on template-based code generation, {eid: 85041446287}>, <A model-driven framework for interoperable cloud resources management, {eid: 84989298330}>, <None, {eid: 85072320278}>, <Model transformation: The heart and soul of model-driven software development, {eid: 0141725642}>, <A model-driven tool chain for occi, {eid: 85032666576}>, <Model-driven generation of microservice architectures for benchmarking performance and resilience engineering approaches, {eid: 85019479213}>, <An infrastructure modelling tool for cloud provisioning, {eid: 85032348388}>, <Model-driven elasticity for cloud resources, {eid: 85048474527}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2019-07-08,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85072317965,True,True,False,False

The main objective of these systems is to shorten delivery times and to ensure a proper execution of the deployment process. However, these systems mainly focus on the correct technical execution of the deployment, but do not check whether the deployed application is working properly. Especially in DevOps scenarios where applications are modified frequently, this can quickly lead to broken deployments, for example, if a wrong component version was specified in the deployment model that has not been adapted to a new database schema. Ironically, even hardly noticeable errors in deployment models quickly result in technically successful deployments, which do not work at all. In this paper, we tackle these issues. We present a modeling concept that enables developers to define deployment tests directly along with the deployment model. These tests are then automatically run by a runtime after deployment to verify that the application is working properly. To validate the technical feasibility of the approach, we applied the concept to TOSCA and extended an existing open source TOSCA runtime.","Declarative Application Deployement, Model-based Testing, Test Automation, Testing, TOSCA",,,,,,,,"<Why enterprises must adopt devops to enable continuous delivery, {eid: 84860316008}>, <Why do internet services fail, what can be done about it, {eid: 84875570984}>, <Integrated cloud application provisioning: Interconnecting service-centric and script-centric management technologies, {eid: 84886738018}>, <None, {eid: 85059053971}>, <None, {eid: 85059080207}>, <A systematic review of cloud modeling languages, {eid: 85042469266}>, <None, {eid: 84886743417}>, <None, {eid: 84902315977}>, <Declarative vs imperative: Two modeling patterns for the automated deployment of applications, {eid: 85050411724}>, <Combining Declarative and Imperative Cloud Application Provisioning based on TOSCA, {eid: 84908563698}>, <None, {eid: 85059077974}>, <How do developers react to RESTful API evolution, {eid: 85059072808}>, <Migrating to cloud-native architectures using microservices: An experience report, {eid: 84966526539}>, <None, {eid: 85059067756}>, <Internet of things out of the Box: Using TOSCA for automating the deployment of iot environments, {eid: 85024391376}>, <Generic driver injection for automated IoT application deployments, {eid: 85059069362}>, <Standards-based devops automation and integration using TOSCA, {eid: 84946692273}>, <Integrating configuration management with model-driven cloud management based on TOSCA, {eid: 84884491041}>, <Policy4TOSCA: A policy-aware cloud service provisioning approach to enable secure cloud computing, {eid: 84979757687}>, <Policy-aware provisioning plan generation for TOSCA-based applications, {eid: 85061523056}>, <None, {eid: 85018343171}>, <Winery-A modeling tool for TOSCA-based cloud applications, {eid: 84903571458}>, <Open TOSCA-A runtime for TOSCA-based cloud applications, {eid: 84903571458}>, <A taxonomy of model-based testing approaches, {eid: 84862325128}>, <None, {eid: 3943049689}>, <Model-based testing in practice, {eid: 0032660359}>, <Model-based approach to security test automation, {eid: 0006564418}>, <Requirement-based automated black-box test generation, {eid: 0035170677}>, <A UML-Based approach to system testing, {eid: 4344612500}>, <Towards deploying model-based testing with a domain-specific modeling approach, {eid: 38049107184}>, <Model-based test case generation for web applications, {eid: 84921039377}>, <Automated model-based performance testing for paas cloud services, {eid: 84931024462}>, <A survey on model-based testing approaches: A systematic review, {eid: 69549103676}>, <Service functional test automation, {eid: 85059070586}>, <None, {eid: 84858197925}>, <A survey of software testing in the cloud, {eid: 84866935316}>, <Testing idempotence for infrastructure as code, {eid: 84902547810}>, <None, {eid: 85024364052}>, <A GENTL approach for cloud application topologies, {eid: 85059075727}>, <Topology splitting and matching for multi-cloud deployments, {eid: 85019266003}>, <Portable cloud services using TOSCA, {eid: 84860434499}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2018-10-16,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85059064282,False,False,False,False

Image analysis and detection, control, speech recognition, translation are only a few prominent examples tackled successfully by neural networks. Thereby, the discipline imposes a completely new problem solving paradigm requiring a rethinking of classical software development methods. The high demand for deep learning technology has led to a large amount of competing frameworks mostly having a Python interface - a quasi standard in the community. Although, existing tools often provide great flexibility and high performance, they still lack to deliver a completely domain oriented problem view. Furthermore, using neural networks as reusable building blocks with clear interfaces in productive systems is still a challenge. In this work we propose a domain specific modeling methodology tackling design, training, and integration of deep neural networks. Thereby, we distinguish between three main modeling concerns: architecture, training, and data. We integrate our methodology in a component-based modeling toolchain allowing one to employ and reuse neural networks in large software architectures.","deep learning, model-driven software engineering, neural networks",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84961087827}>, <Speech recognition with deep recurrent neural networks, {eid: 84890543083}>, <Deepdriving: Learning affordance for direct perception in autonomous driving, {eid: 84973888858}>, <None, {eid: 85029443880}>, <None, {eid: 6344235947}>, <None, {eid: 85075941065}>, <None, {eid: 33646566908}>, <Highly-optimizing and multi-target compiler for embedded system models: C++ compiler toolchain for the component and connector language embedded monti arc, {eid: 85056871758}>, <None, {eid: 0003880013}>, <ROS: An open-source robot operating system, {eid: 77957352104}>, <Benchmarking state-of-The-art deep learning software tools, {eid: 85027446064}>, <None, {eid: 84979557463}>, <The numpy array: A structure for efficient numerical computation, {eid: 79952595565}>, <Torch7: A matlab-like environment for machine learning, {eid: 84888340666}>, <None, {eid: 5044234815}>, <Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning, {eid: 85075670920}>, <None, {eid: 84978978745}>, <Caffe: Convolutional architecture for fast feature embedding, {eid: 84913580146}>, <None, {eid: 82655166506}>, <An overview of the hdf5 technology suite and its applications, {eid: 79956025832}>, <Deep residual learning for image recognition, {eid: 84986274465}>, <None, {eid: 84990032982}>, <Cntk: Microsofts open-source deeplearning toolkit, {eid: 85040107379}>, <None, {eid: 0003396255}>, <An overview of the HDF5 technology suite and its applications, {eid: 80052992397}>, <None, {eid: 85076103141}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <MorphNet: Fast & simple resource-constrained structure learning of deep networks, {eid: 85058146752}>, <None, {eid: 85076105694}>, <Convolutional networks and applications in vision, {eid: 77955998889}>, <Modeling architectures of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85025124378}>, <Backpropagation applied to handwritten zip code recognition, {eid: 0000359337}>, <None, {eid: 0040406981}>, <None, {eid: 84919728106}>, <On the properties of neural machine translation: Encoder-decoder approaches, {eid: 85097641926}>, <None, {eid: 84941620184}>, <Embedded MontiArc: Textual modeling alternative to simulink, {eid: 85060443298}>, <Model-based development of self-adaptive autonomous vehicles using the SMARDT methodology, {eid: 85052024078}>, <Component-based integration of interconnected vehicle architectures, {eid: 85072280010}>, <OCL framework to verify extra-functional properties in component and connector models, {eid: 85041439005}>, <Component and connector views in practice: An experience report, {eid: 85040631558}>, <Behavioral compatibility of simulink models for product line maintenance and evolution, {eid: 85009379870}>, <None, {eid: 76249122848}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-09-15,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85075936455,True,False,True,False

The advantage is a much more efficient validation of the models, with more robust and durable representations, that ensure effective and efficient quality assurance throughout the development process, saving the costly exercise of formal model-checking until the system is complete enough to meet all requirements.","Finite-State Machines, Model-Driven Development, Real-Time Systems, Software Models, Test-Driven Development, Validation and Model-Checking",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85159115952}>, <None, {eid: 84959243564}>, <Security challenges for medical devices, {eid: 84925779811}>, <Software health management: A necessity for safety critical systems, {eid: 84888297725}>, <Requirements engineering via non-monotonic logics and state diagrams, {eid: 83755216028}>, <Arrangements of finite-state machines semantics, simulation, and model checking, {eid: 84878096152}>, <High performance relaying of C++11 objects across processes and logic-labeled finite-state machines, {eid: 84921693633}>, <Correctness by construction with logic-labeled finite-state machines -comparison with Event-B, {eid: 84903531179}>, <Efficient modelling of embedded software systems and their formal verification, {eid: 84874629026}>, <Module isolation for efficient model checking and its application to FMEA in model-driven engineering, {eid: 84887041149}>, <NuSMV: A new symbolic model checker, {eid: 84896869660}>, <Efficient model checking and FMEA analysis with deterministic scheduling of transition-labeled finite-state machines, {eid: 84873686788}>, <Visual-trace simulation of concurrent finite-state machines for validation and model-checking of complex behavior, {eid: 84868031470}>, <Embedded systems in UML, {eid: 84868006865}>, <None, {eid: 0003546951}>, <None, {eid: 85055229985}>, <From requirements to embedded software -formalising the key steps, {eid: 70349514686}>, <Reasoning about goal-directed real-time teleo-reactive programs, {eid: 84900855679}>, <Improving the trustworthiness of medical device software with formal verification methods, {eid: 84883573451}>, <A safety-assured development approach for real-time software, {eid: 78449302431}>, <Ui-design driven model-based testing, {eid: 84881490451}>, <None, {eid: 0003962322}>, <None, {eid: 70649097503}>, <None, {eid: 84869854783}>, <Model-based testing of embedded systems in hardware in the loop environment, {eid: 84866874472}>, <Model-based testing of automotive software: Some challenges and solutions, {eid: 84944111601}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2015-10-06,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-84994571015,True,False,True,False

We investigate how the inherent encapsulation of component and connector (C&C) architectures can be used to develop and deploy reliable IoT applications. Existing C&C languages for the development of IoT applications mainly focus on the description of architectures and the distribution of components to IoT devices. Furthermore, related approaches often pollute the models with low-level implementation details, tying the models to a particular platform and making them harder to understand. In this paper, we introduce MontiThings, a C&C language offering automatic error handling capabilities and a clear separation between business logic and implementation details. The error-handling methods presented in this paper can make C&C-based IoT applications more reliable without cluttering the business logic with error-handling code that is time-consuming to develop and makes the models hard to understand, especially for non-experts.","Architecture modeling, Code generation, Deployment, Internet of Things, Model-driven engineering",,,,,,,,"<Model-driven separation of concerns for service robotics, {eid: 85015193041}>, <Enterprise information systems in academia and practice: Lessons learned from a MBSE project, {eid: 85115262972}>, <On the deployment of IoT systems: An industrial survey, {eid: 85085747272}>, <Requirement-based deployment of applications in Calvin, {eid: 85018622215}>, <MSL: A pattern language for engineering self-adaptive systems, {eid: 85080064786}>, <Integrated data management for a fleet of search-and-rescue robots, {eid: 84978500286}>, <Situational context in the programmable world, {eid: 85050184835}>, <Implementing Domain-Specific Languages with Xtext and Xtend, {eid: 84906918277}>, <Modern Control Systems Analysis and Design using MATLAB and SIMULINK, {eid: 0004064857}>, <Toward a distributed data flow platform for the web of things (distributed node-RED), {eid: 84984984329}>, <A component architecture for the internet of things, {eid: 85045755257}>, <Specification and Development of Interactive Systems.

The language in which requirements are written is mostly informal and highly individual. This hinders automated processing of requirements as well as the linking of requirements to models. Introducing formal requirement notations in existing projects leads to the challenge of translating masses of requirements and the necessity of training for requirements engineers. In this paper, we derive domain-specific language constructs helping us to avoid ambiguities in requirements and increase the level of formality. The main contribution is the adoption and evaluation of few-shot learning with large pretrained language models for the automated translation of informal requirements to structured languages such as a requirement DSL.","few-shot learning, model-driven engineering, model-driven requirements engineering, natural language processing",,,,,,,,"<A Zero-Shot Learning Approach to Classifying Requirements: A Preliminary Study, {eid: 85127051029}>, <Artifact and Reference Models for Generative Machine Learning Frameworks and Build Systems, {eid: 85120851738}>, <Interoperable Toolchain for Requirements-Driven Model-Based Development, {eid: 85146981366}>, <None, {eid: 85147039607}>, <Component and Connector Views in Practice: An Experience Report, {eid: 85040631558}>, <None, {eid: 85090303288}>, <Grand Challenges in Model-Driven Engineering: An Analysis of the State of Research, {eid: 85077634676}>, <None, {eid: 85092112367}>, <None, {eid: 85057019815}>, <A Methodology for Retrofitting Generative Aspects in Existing Applications, {eid: 85122045750}>, <SMArDT modeling for automotive software testing, {eid: 85055705898}>, <Modellierung, Verifikation und Synthese von validen Planungszuständen für Fernsehausstrahlungen, {eid: 85147040543}>, <Semantic Evolution Analysis of Feature Models, {eid: 85143076817}>, <Model-driven Development of Complex Software: A Research Roadmap, {eid: 34748861160}>, <Meaningful Modeling: Whats the Semantics of ""Semantics"", {eid: 7244261750}>, <NoRBERT: Transfer learning for requirements classification, {eid: 85091480468}>, <Clustering Natural Language Test Case Instructions as Input for Deriving Automotive Testing DSLs, {eid: 85109428691}>, <Modeling Dynamic Architectures of Self-Adaptive Cooperative Systems, {eid: 85075948566}>, <An Approach for Logic-based Knowledge Representation and Automated Reasoning over Underspecification and Refinement in Safety-Critical Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85082966829}>, <Modeling and Training of Neural Processing Systems, {eid: 85075936455}>, <On the Engineering of AI-Powered Systems, {eid: 85079270211}>, <Modeling Architectures of Cyber-Physical Systems, {eid: 85025124378}>, <None, {eid: 85143067431}>, <A Systematic Reviewof the Use of Requirements Engineering Techniques in Model-Driven Development, {eid: 80055026559}>, <Software requirement-specific entity extraction using transformer models, {eid: 85143058768}>, <A Machine Learning Approach to Software Requirements Prioritization, {eid: 84875692349}>, <None, {eid: 82455195427}>, <None, {eid: 85056475484}>, <Detection of Hidden Feature Requests from Massive Chat Messages via Deep Siamese Network, {eid: 85094317439}>, <Cyber Physical Systems: Analyses, challenges and possible solutions, {eid: 85134027388}>, <Attention is all you need, {eid: 85043317328}>, <None, {eid: 85119143718}>, <None, {eid: 85110956191}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2022-12-06,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85143075634,False,False,False,False

Consequently, the amount of neural network code in software rises continuously. To make the new paradigm more accessible, frameworks, languages, and tools keep emerging. Although, the maturity of these tools is steadily increasing, we still lack appropriate domain specific languages and a high degree of automation when it comes to deep learning for productive systems. In this paper we present a multi-paradigm language family allowing the AI engineer to model and train deep neural networks as well as to integrate them into software architectures containing classical code. Using input and output layers as strictly typed interfaces enables a seamless embedding of neural networks into component-based models. The lifecycle of deep learning components can then be governed by a compiler accordingly, e.g. detecting when (re-)training is necessary or when network weights can be shared between different network instances. We provide a compelling case study, where we train an autonomous vehicle for the TORCS simulator. Furthermore, we discuss how the methodology automates the AI development process if neural networks are changed or added to the system.","Deep learning, Mde, Neural networks",,,,,,,,"<Modeling and training of neural processing systems, {eid: 85075936455}>, <Modeling architectures of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85025124378}>, <Highly-optimizing and multi-Target compiler for embedded system models: C++ compiler toolchain for the component and connector language embeddedmontiarc, {eid: 85056871758}>, <Simulink user?s guide.Technical report r2019a, {eid: 85080014559}>, <Tensorflow: A system for large-scale machine learning, {eid: 85075670920}>, <Torch7: A matlab-like environment for machine learning, {eid: 84888340666}>, <None, {eid: 85079977198}>, <Collaborative hyperparameter tuning, {eid: 84882279850}>, <None, {eid: 85079981380}>, <Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, {eid: 84876231242}>, <Convolutional networks and applications in vision, {eid: 77955998889}>, <Deepdriving: Learning affordance for direct perception in autonomous driving, {eid: 84973888858}>, <Torcs, the open racing car simulator, {eid: 85046286984}>, <None, {eid: 85010075270}>, <None, {eid: 85053070397}>, <Pedram mir seyed nazari, {eid: 85079968713}>, <Imagenet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, {eid: 84876231242}>, <Engineering tagging languages for dsls, {eid: 84961634193}>, <Ros: An open-source robot operating system, {eid: 77957352104}>, <Component-based integration of interconnected vehicle architectures, {eid: 85072280010}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-11-10,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85079270211,True,True,False,False

NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) sees MBSE as a key approach to managing the complexity of system development. However, balancing agility and rigor in MBSE has been reported as a challenging task not yet addressed by modeling tools and frameworks. This is because existing MBSE approaches may enable agility but compromise rigor, or enhance rigor but impede agility. We discuss the challenges of balancing agility and rigor in MBSE across seven systems engineering architectural functions defined by the JPL Integrated Model-Centric Engineering (IMCE) initiative. We demonstrate how openCAESAR, an open-source MBSE methodology and framework created at JPL, can strike a balance between agility and rigor through a case study of the Kepler16b project and discussion of lessons learned from past projects.","Model-Based Systems Engineering, OML, Ontology-based Modeling, openCAESAR, Systems Engineering",,,,,,,,"<Model-based systems engineering: Motivation, current status, and research opportunities, {eid: 85046694426}>, <Value and benefits of model-based systems engineering (MBSE): Evidence from the literature, {eid: 85098450048}>, <State-of-practice survey of model-based systems, {eid: 85052963713}>, <None, {eid: 2342509886}>, <A survey of devops concepts and challenges, {eid: 85075608026}>, <CAESAR model-based approach to harness design, {eid: 85092558185}>, <Ontological Metamodeling and Analysis Using openCAESAR, {eid: 85182396192}>, <Ontology building for cyber-physical systems: Application in the manufacturing domain, {eid: 85085751213}>, <Balancing systems engineering rigor with agile software development flexibility, {eid: 85171892288}>, <Investigating relationships and semantic sets amongst system lifecycle properties (ilities), {eid: 84938572797}>, <Agility in the future of systems engineering (FuSE)-a roadmap of foundational concepts, {eid: 85163738551}>, <Models as enablers of agility in complex systems engineering, {eid: 85130817821}>, <Systematic literature review of MBSE tool-chains, {eid: 85127743743}>, <A Survey on MBSE Adoption Challenges, {eid: 85106386252}>, <Model-based systems engineering: An emerging approach for modern systems, {eid: 84655170010}>, <None, {eid: 85182394753}>, <Towards agile model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85041433552}>, <DSMCompare: Domain-specific model differencing for graphical domainspecific languages, {eid: 85122347279}>, <Semantically-rigorous systems engineering modeling using SysML and OWL, {eid: 84906870818}>, <Application of agile model-based systems engineering in aircraft conceptual design, {eid: 85060448994}>, <10.5. 1 an MBSE case study and research challenges, {eid: 84939228470}>, <Applying model based systems engineering (MBSE) to a standard cubesat, {eid: 84861121452}>, <MBSE applications for the MSR SRC Mars Ascent Vehicle, {eid: 85137577843}>, <An MBSE architectural framework for the agile definition of system stakeholders, needs and requirements, {eid: 85124455676}>, <Ontologybased design of space systems, {eid: 84992660381}>, <Towards an open platform for democratized model-based design and engineering of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85182390527}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-10-01,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85182402872,False,False,False,False

However, to come from the design of MSAs to running applications, substantial knowledge and technology-specific expertise in the deployment and integration of microservices is needed. In this paper, we propose a model-driven and pattern-based approach for composing microservices, which facilitates the transition from architectural models to running deployments. Using a unified modelling for MSAs, including both their integration based on Enterprise Integration Patterns (EIPs) and deployment aspects, our approach enables automatically generating the artefacts for deploying microservice compositions. This helps abstracting away the underlying infrastructure including container orchestration platforms and middleware layer for service integration. To validate the feasibility of our approach, we illustrate its prototypical implementation, with Kubernetes used as container orchestration system and OpenFaaS used for managing integration logic, and we present a case study.","Enterprise Integration Pattern, Microservice Architecture, Model-driven Engineering, Service Composition",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84950338538}>, <None, {eid: 84964234114}>, <Microservices tenets, {eid: 84995489225}>, <The pains and gains of microservices: A systematic grey literature review, {eid: 85054175054}>, <Architectural patterns for microservices: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85093984653}>, <None, {eid: 10044221068}>, <Towards a taxonomy of microservices architectures, {eid: 85042125420}>, <Contextual understanding of microservice architecture: Current and future directions, {eid: 85049370573}>, <None, {eid: 84937681996}>, <Containers and cloud: From lxc to docker to kubernetes, {eid: 84923248887}>, <Declarative vs. Imperative: Two Modeling Patterns for the Automated Deployment of Applications, {eid: 85050411724}>, <None, {eid: 0003752204}>, <None, {eid: 85096576488}>, <Microservices: Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, {eid: 85054938535}>, <Microservices: The journey so far and challenges ahead, {eid: 85046893906}>, <Towards integrating microservices with adaptable enterprise architecture, {eid: 84992626303}>, <Microart: A software architecture recovery tool for maintaining microservice-based systems, {eid: 85025579355}>, <Microservice ambients: An architectural meta-modelling approach for microservice granularity, {eid: 85021456926}>, <Freshening the air in microservices: Resolving architectural smells via refactoring, {eid: 85084862852}>, <Microservices-lightweight service descriptions for rest architectural style, {eid: 77956283865}>, <Aspect-oriented challenges in system integration with microservices, soa and iot, {eid: 85045152190}>, <Incremental integration of microservices in cloud applications, {eid: 84995923681}>, <Microservices: A language-based approach, {eid: 85041830332}>, <Circuit breakers, discovery, and API gateways in microservices, {eid: 85048621033}>, <None, {eid: 85096558746}>, <An architecture for self-managing microservices, {eid: 84958972998}>, <Container and microservice driven design for cloud infrastructure devops, {eid: 84978128210}>, <Beethoven: An event-driven lightweight platform for microservice orchestration, {eid: 85057285607}>, <A dashboard for microservice monitoring and management, {eid: 85025678915}>, <Model-based engineering for microservice architectures using enterprise integration patterns for inter-service communication, {eid: 85031757791}>, <Medley: An event-driven lightweight platform for service composition, {eid: 84977485477}>, <The edmm modeling and transformation system, {eid: 85084788084}>, <None, {eid: 85046797891}>, <Leveraging Pattern Application via Pattern Refinement, {eid: 85038447563}>, <Cloud Data Patterns for Confidentiality, {eid: 84864874794}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2020-10-05,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096537599,False,False,False,True

Before such techniques can be used, though, data under analysis commonly need to be formatted into two-dimensional tables. This constraint is imposed by data mining algorithms, which typically require a collection of records as input for their computations. The process of extracting data from the corresponding sources and formatting them properly can become error-prone and cumbersome. In the case of models, this process is mostly carried out through scripts written in a model management language, such as EOL or ATL. To improve this situation, we present Pinset, a domain-specific language devised for the extraction of tabular datasets from software models. Pinset offers a tailored syntax and built-in facilities for common activities in dataset extraction. For evaluation, Pinset has been used on UML class diagrams to calculate metrics that can be employed as input for several fault-prediction algorithms. The use of Pinset for this calculations led to more compact and high-level specifications when compared to equivalent scripts written in generic model management languages.","Data Mining, Domain-Specific Languages, Model-Driven Engineering, Software Quality",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85009962818}>, <A systematic review of machine learning techniques for software fault prediction, {eid: 84919754115}>, <Investigating code smell co-occurrences using association rule learning: A replicated study, {eid: 85018335521}>, <Using machine learning to design a flexible LOC counter, {eid: 85018331426}>, <Predictive mutation testing, {eid: 85062193490}>, <An extensive comparison of bug prediction approaches, {eid: 77953782938}>, <Travistorrent: Synthesizing travis ci and github for full-stack research on continuous integration, {eid: 85026557876}>, <Mining metrics for understanding metamodel characteristics, {eid: 84911465837}>, <None, {eid: 0004121211}>, <ATL: A model transformation tool, {eid: 45849085734}>, <The design of a conceptual framework and technical infrastructure for model management language engineering, {eid: 70350041761}>, <A metrics suite for object oriented design, {eid: 0028446078}>, <The quest for open source projects that use uml: Mining github, {eid: 85008473064}>, <The epsilon transformation language, {eid: 54249141728}>, <The KDD process for extracting useful knowledge from volumes of data, {eid: 0030285403}>, <Automatic feature selection by regularization to improve bug prediction accuracy, {eid: 85018351732}>, <Predicting software defects with causality tests, {eid: 84900800922}>, <Automated parameter optimization of classification techniques for defect prediction models, {eid: 84971421988}>, <Combining unit and specification-based testing for meta-model validation and verification, {eid: 84994525407}>, <The epsilon object language (EOL), {eid: 33746467089}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2018-09-04,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85061315485,False,False,True,False

Our approach aligns development process to this toolkit and coordinates domain modeling activity over project life cycles. In this paper, we describe its framework and corresponding development process which eliminates delays brought by the uncertainty of a project at a relatively early stage. Several minimum viable products have been built upon the proposed approach during the past years, including automated generation of code from domain decomposition. Our result shows 10% saving of effort and fewer issues. Effort saving increases to 30% under an extreme condition with high-rate personnel turnover.

In many safety critical application domains, runtime monitors (or runtime verification) are used to enforce operational safety and security. One of the challenges in runtime verification is to identify the critical safety properties that we want to monitor at runtime. In this paper, we explore how structural verification activities in a Model Based Design and Engineering (MBDE) context help formulate more effective monitoring specifications to cover vulnerable areas in a system. We assert that leveraging synergy between design and runtime verification produces more informed runtime safety monitors. This approach of integrating design assurance and runtime safety and security is an important aspect of the dependable DevOps continuum process. To demonstrate this, we perform verification of an Emergency Diesel Generator Startup Sequencer (EDGSS) implemented on an FPGA overlay architecture using model-based verification techniques. We present our key findings on synergy between runtime verification and design processes to support a more inclusive safety case.","DevOps, Industrial Cyber Physical Systems, Model-based engineering, Runtime verification",,,,,,,,"<Model-based systems engineering: An emerging approach for modern systems, {eid: 84655170010}>, <None, {eid: 84883136062}>, <Towards a model-based devops for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85079099244}>, <Towards a secure devops approach for cyber-physical systems: An industrial perspective, {eid: 85106659186}>, <Overview of iec 61508. design of electrical/electronic/programmable electronic safety-related systems, {eid: 0033902909}>, <None, {eid: 85112350776}>, <None, {eid: 85112359412}>, <Assume-guarantee testing, {eid: 79959259531}>, <Property-based fault injection: A novel approach to model-based fault injection for safety critical systems, {eid: 85091292067}>, <None, {eid: 1642497296}>, <Your what is my how: Why requirements and architectural design should be iterative, {eid: 84870841976}>, <Industry 4. 0 as a cyber-physical system study, {eid: 84956605744}>, <Towards a taxonomy for eliciting design-operation continuum requirements of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85093982993}>, <Twinops-devops meets model-based engineering and digital twins for the engineering of cps, {eid: 85096747019}>, <Combining testing and runtime verification techniques, {eid: 84883352338}>, <Dependable adas by combining design time testing and runtime monitoring, {eid: 84922323290}>, <Safety and security in cyber-physical systems and internet-of-things systems, {eid: 85048031318}>, <Testing meets static and runtime verification, {eid: 85052058154}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-05-10,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85112350140,False,False,False,False

For this, architects need to examine those requirements with regard to their architectural impact. Accessing and interpreting the requirements is however not always possible, for instance if custom requirements are yet unknown at the time when the architecture is modeled. Ideally, architectural knowledge as derived from custom requirements could be imposed upon architecture models. This paper proposes a novel concept for automated refactoring of architecture models in order to meet such requirements by formalizing architectural knowledge using model verification and model transformations.

Selecting the most promising test cases to detect bugs is hard if there are uncertainties on the impact of committed code changes or, if traceability links between code and tests are not available. This paper introduces Retecs, a new method for automatically learning test case selection and prioritization in CI with the goal to minimize the round-trip time between code commits and developer feedback on failed test cases. The Retecs method uses reinforcement learning to select and prioritize test cases according to their duration, previous last execution and failure history. In a constantly changing environment, where new test cases are created and obsolete test cases are deleted, the Retecs method learns to prioritize error-prone test cases higher under guidance of a reward function and by observing previous CI cycles. By applying Retecs on data extracted from three industrial case studies, we show for the first time that reinforcement learning enables fruitful automatic adaptive test case selection and prioritization in CI and regression testing.","Continuous Integration, Machine Learning, Regression testing, Reinforcement Learning, Test case prioritization, Test case selection",,,,,,,,"<Apprenticeship learning via inverse reinforcement learning, {eid: 31844444663}>, <Improving proceeding test case prioritization with learning software agents, {eid: 84902356655}>, <Active learning for automatic classification of software behavior, {eid: 22944435659}>, <Learning for test prioritization: An industrial case study, {eid: 84997235107}>, <Clustering based novel test case prioritization technique, {eid: 84983233375}>, <Using semi-supervised clustering to improve regression test selection techniques, {eid: 79958759034}>, <A multi-objective particle swarm optimization for test case selection based on functional requirements coverage and execution effort, {eid: 84855811230}>, <Search based constrained test case selection using execution effort, {eid: 84885031013}>, <Coverage-based regression test case selection, minimization and prioritization: A case study on an industrial system, {eid: 84928926856}>, <None, {eid: 38549173069}>, <None, {eid: 85026650757}>, <Techniques for improving regression testing in continuous integration development environments, {eid: 84986877429}>, <None, {eid: 0006705483}>, <Ekstazi: Lightweight test selection, {eid: 84951764887}>, <Lightweight automated testing with adaptation-based programming, {eid: 84876394399}>, <A history-based test prioritization technique for regression testing in resource constrained environments, {eid: 0036041041}>, <Test case prioritization based on information retrieval concepts, {eid: 84951272973}>, <Self-improving reactive agents based on reinforcement learning, planning and teaching, {eid: 0000123778}>, <Test case prioritization for continuous regression testing: An industrial case study, {eid: 84891715780}>, <Reward functions for accelerated learning, {eid: 84957895797}>, <Size-constrained regression test case selection using multicriteria optimization, {eid: 84864606587}>, <History-based test case prioritization for black box testing using ant colony optimization, {eid: 84935096380}>, <A similarity-based approach for test case prioritization using historical failure data, {eid: 84964844271}>, <Software testing: A research travelogue (2000-2014), {eid: 84979703490}>, <Historical value-based approach for cost- cognizant test case prioritization to improve the effectiveness of regression testing, {eid: 51749110666}>, <Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Pjython, {eid: 80555140075}>, <Test case prioritization for multiple processing queues, {eid: 62449129360}>, <Combinatorial interac-tionregressiontesting: Astudyoftestcase generationandprioritization, {eid: 47349111813}>, <Risk-based interoperability testing using reinforcement learning, {eid: 85026664193}>, <Neural fitted Q iteration - First experiences with a data efficient neural Reinforcement Learning method, {eid: 33646398129}>, <Test case prioritization: An empirical study, {eid: 0033326792}>, <Prioritizing test cases for regression testing, {eid: 0035481183}>, <An information retrieval approach for regression test prioritization basedon program changes, {eid: 84951789291}>, <Enabling agile testing through continuous integration, {eid: 70449678931}>, <Experience report: Automated system level regression test prioritization using multiple factors, {eid: 85013287871}>, <None, {eid: 0004102479}>, <Reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces, {eid: 34548807200}>, <None, {eid: 0013153953}>, <None, {eid: 43049140624}>, <Time-aware test suite prioritization, {eid: 34247327814}>, <None, {eid: 84855242052}>, <None, {eid: 78650186589}>, <Time-aware test-case prioritization using integer linear programming, {eid: 85008264025}>, <Solving large scale linear prediction problems using stochastic gradient descent algorithms, {eid: 14344259207}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2017-07-10,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85026639599,True,False,True,False

Even though dedicated development environments are in place, a non-expert user might struggle with the over-choice problem in selecting the proper component. By combining MDE and recommender systems, this paper proposes an initial prototype, called ResyDuo, to assist Arduino developers by providing two different artifacts, i.e., hardware components and software libraries. In particular, we make use of a widely adopted collaborative filtering algorithm by collecting relevant information by means of a dedicated data model. ResyDuo can retrieve hardware components by using tags or existing Arduino projects stored on the ProjectHub repository. Then, the system can eventually retrieve corresponding software libraries based on the identified hardware devices. ResyDuo is equipped with a web-based interface that allows users to easily select and configure the under-developing Arduino project. To assess ResyDuo's performances, we run the ten-fold cross-validation by adopting the grid search strategy to optimize the hyperparameters of the CF-based algorithm. The conducted evaluation shows encouraging results even though there is still room for improvement in terms of the examined metrics.","IoT development, Model-Driven Engineering, Recommendation Systems",,,,,,,,"<Internet of Things: Applications and Challenges in Technology and Standardization, {eid: 79959280293}>, <The Internet of Things: A survey, {eid: 77956877124}>, <IoT technologies for embedded computing: A survey, {eid: 84995379866}>, <Iot bugs and development challenges, {eid: 85115711213}>, <None, {eid: 85171336790}>, <A model-based framework for IoT systems in wastewater treatment plants, {eid: 85166905440}>, <Modelbased analysis support for dependable complex systems in CHESS, {eid: 85171322972}>, <None, {eid: 84948114701}>, <None, {eid: 77955202099}>, <Software assistants in software engineering: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 85144071056}>, <None, {eid: 85069151852}>, <Cross-validation, {eid: 79954553074}>, <None, {eid: 85065146640}>, <None, {eid: 85171350885}>, <ThingML: A Language and Code Generation Framework for Heterogeneous Targets, {eid: 85008457888}>, <Modeling iot applications with sysml4iot, {eid: 85020698595}>, <Model-driven engineering for mission-critical iot systems, {eid: 85010302951}>, <Building blocks for IoT testing-a benchmark of IoT apps and a functional testing framework, {eid: 85136201974}>, <Multi-paradigm modelling for cyber-physical systems: A descriptive framework, {eid: 85107508780}>, <Conceptualizing digital twins, {eid: 85120045327}>, <Devopsml: Towards modeling devops processes and platforms, {eid: 85096806448}>, <None, {eid: 34249990939}>, <Recommender systems and linked open data, {eid: 84951007211}>, <User-based collaborative-filtering recommendation algorithms on hadoop, {eid: 77952180804}>, <Item-based collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms, {eid: 85052617391}>, <Crossed wires: Investigating the problems of end-user developers in a physical computing task, {eid: 84995787982}>, <Surprise: A python library for recommender systems, {eid: 85095915907}>, <Performance evaluation of recommender systems, {eid: 85038570002}>, <Nearest neighbor pattern classification, {eid: 84926662675}>, <Grid search in hyperparameter optimization of machine learning models for prediction of HIV/aids test results, {eid: 85114673688}>, <Collaborative filtering recommender systems, {eid: 34249990939}>, <Cosine similarity to determine similarity measure: Study case in online essay assessment, {eid: 84994086881}>, <None, {eid: 85139430410}>, <MUDABlue: An automatic categorization system for open source repositories, {eid: 18944403532}>, <Tag-aware recommender systems based on deep neural networks, {eid: 84963829745}>, <TGCN: Tag Graph Convolutional Network for Tag-Aware Recommendation, {eid: 85095862694}>, <JIT2R: A Joint Framework for Item Tagging and Tag-based Recommendation, {eid: 85090145629}>, <Automated library recommendation, {eid: 84893346645}>, <Diversified thirdparty library prediction for mobile app development, {eid: 85072166366}>, <Crossrec: Supporting software developers by recommending thirdparty libraries, {eid: 85075896516}>, <Req2lib: A semantic neural model for software library recommendation, {eid: 85083549113}>, <Embedding app-library graph for neural third party library recommendation, {eid: 85116207161}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-10-01,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85182400005,False,False,True,False

In the O-RAN specifications, the RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) are software-defined orchestration and automation functions for the intelligent management of RAN. This article introduces principles for machine learning (ML), in particular, reinforcement learning (RL) applications in the O-RAN stack. Furthermore, we review the state-of-the-art research in wireless networks and cast it onto the RAN framework and the hierarchy of the O-RAN architecture. We provide a taxonomy for the challenges faced by ML/RL models throughout the development life-cycle: from the system specification to production deployment (data acquisition, model design, testing and management, etc.). To address the challenges, we integrate a set of existing MLOps principles with unique characteristics when RL agents are considered. This paper discusses a systematic model development, testing and validation life-cycle, termed: RLOps. We discuss fundamental parts of RLOps, which include: model specification, development, production environment serving, operations monitoring and safety/security. Based on these principles, we propose the best practices for RLOps to achieve an automated and reproducible model development process. At last, a holistic data analytics platform rooted in the O-RAN deployment is designed and implemented, aiming to embrace and fulfil the aforementioned principles and best practices of RLOps.","data

All rights reserved.The automotive industry is currently in a state of rapid change. The traditional mechanical industry has, forced by electronic revolution and global threats of climate change, transformed into a computerized electromechanical industry. A hybrid or electric car of 2013 can have, in the order of 100 electronic control units, running gigabytes of code, working together in a complex network within the car as well as being connected to networks in the world outside. This exponential increase of software has posed new challenges for the R&D organizations. In many cases the commonly used method of requirement engineering towards external suppliers in a waterfall process has shown to be unmanageable. Part of the solution has been to introduce more in-house software development and the new standardized platform for embedded software, AUTOSAR. During the past few years, Volvo Cars has focused on techniques and processes for continuous integration of embedded software for active safety, body functions, and motor and hybrid technology. The feedback times for ECU system test have decreased from months to, in the best cases, hours. Domain-specific languages (DSL), for both software and physical models, have been used to great extent when developing in-house embedded software at Volvo Cars. The main reasons are the close connection with mechatronic systems (motors, powertrain, servos, etc.), the advantage of having domain experts (not necessarily software experts) developing control software, and the facilitated reuse of algorithms. Model-driven engineering also provides a method for agile development and early learning in projects where hardware and mechanics usually are available only late. Model-based testing of the software is performed, both as pure simulation (MIL) and in hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) rigs, before it is deployed in real cars. This testing is currently being automated for several rigs, as part of the continuous integration strategy. The progress is, however, not without challenges. Details of the work split with Tier 1 suppliers, using the young AUTOSAR standard, and the efficiency of AUTOSAR code are still open problems. Another challenge is to manage the complex model framework required for virtual verification when applied on system level and numerous DSLs have to be executed together.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85025583418}>, <None, {eid: 85025606032}>, <None, {eid: 85025689773}>, <None, {eid: 77954495643}>, <Embedded software: Facts, figures, and future, {eid: 65749098082}>, <Archetypical approaches of fast software development and slow embedded projects, {eid: 84889005076}>, <Extending agile practices in automotive MDE, {eid: 84923852912}>, <Agile model-driven engineering in mechatronic systems -an industrial case study (2014), {eid: 84921391979}>, <AUTOSAR-A worldwide standard is on the road, {eid: 79751532776}>, <A light-weight defect classification scheme for embedded automotive software and its initial evaluation, {eid: 84876399424}>",,,Springer International Publishing,,,2014-08-01,,,,,,,eng,,Book,,,,2-s2.0-84930695275,True,False,False,False

In this paper we describe a Scenarios in the Loop (SCIL) approach. SCIL combines (1) natural language requirements specification based on Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with (2) formal and test-driven requirements modeling and analysis, and (3) integrates discipline-specific tools for software and system validation during development. A central element of SCIL is a flexible and executable scenario-based modeling language, the Scenario Modeling Language for Kotlin (SMLK). SMLK allows for an intuitive requirements formalization, and supports engineers to move iteratively, and continuously aided by automated checks, from stakeholder requirements to the validation of the implemented system. We evaluated the approach using a real example from the field of e-mobility.","Automotive systems engineering, BizDevOps, Requirements analysis, System validation",,,,,,,,"<Modellbasiertes Anforderungsmanagement von Systems-of-Systems am Beispiel des vernetzten Fahrzeugs, {eid: 85051268771}>, <None, {eid: 85096776710}>, <{scenariotools} real-time play-out for test sequence validation in an automotive case study, {eid: 84988009390}>, <Soap opera testing, {eid: 34247584681}>, <{LSCs}: Breathing life into message sequence charts, {eid: 0035393979}>, <None, {eid: 85096810277}>, <SMArDT modeling for automotive software testing, {eid: 85055705898}>, <None, {eid: 84944037468}>, <None, {eid: 84867963508}>, <Towards definitions for release engineering and devops, {eid: 84962216125}>, <Usage of agile practices in mechatronics system desing-potentials, challenges and actual surveys, {eid: 85051557873}>, <ScenarioTools-A tool suite for the scenario-based modeling and analysis of reactive systems, {eid: 85027394534}>, <Evaluating a formal scenario-based method for the requirements analysis in automotive software engineering, {eid: 84960399450}>, <Behavioral programming, {eid: 84863756164}>, <Die Zukunft im Griff, Virtualisierte Tests und XiL für automatisiertes Fahren Fahrerassistenzsysteme, {eid: 85096762101}>, <Integrated and iterative systems engineering and software requirements engineering for technical systems, {eid: 84971484567}>, <Model-driven engineering practices in industry: Social, organizational and managerial factors that lead to success or failure, {eid: 84900499307}>, <None, {eid: 85096749880}>, <None, {eid: 0003726721}>, <None, {eid: 85096797445}>, <None, {eid: 85096800583}>, <None, {eid: 85096765476}>, <None, {eid: 85096744727}>, <None, {eid: 79953862404}>, <None, {eid: 85096746928}>, <Use, potential, and showstoppers of models in automotive requirements engineering, {eid: 85047393082}>, <Organisation and communication problems in automotive requirements engineering, {eid: 84994509953}>, <Verifikation und Validierung im Produktentstehungsprozess, {eid: 84978065480}>, <Where is the proof-A review of experiences from applying mde in industry, {eid: 70349858084}>, <None, {eid: 85096763954}>, <Synthesizing tests for combinatorial coverage of modal scenario specifications, {eid: 84961636947}>, <Status of the development of iso/sae 21434, {eid: 85053121537}>, <Twelve systems engineering roles, {eid: 24044504613}>, <None, {eid: 85096788201}>, <Scenario-based requirements engineering, {eid: 84897615313}>, <None, {eid: 85091753206}>, <None, {eid: 85089542039}>, <None, {eid: 85018396952}>, <None, {eid: 85096798351}>, <Feature dependencies in automotive software systems: Extent, awareness, and refactoring, {eid: 85074794408}>, <Test-driven scenario specification of automotive software components, {eid: 85075925849}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2020-10-16,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096773418,False,False,False,False

Usually product analysts, developers, and testers manually write BDD test scenarios that describe system behaviors. Testers write implementation for the BDD scenarios by hand and execute the Cucumber tests. Cucumber provides transparency about what test scenarios are covered and how the test scenarios are mapped to executable tests. One drawback of the Cucumber BDD approach is that test scenarios are generated manually. Thus, the test scenarios are usually weak. More importantly, practitioners do not have a metric to measure test coverage. In this paper, we present a Model-Based Testing (MBT) tool, skyfire. Skyfire can automatically generate effective Cucumber test scenarios to replace manually generated test scenarios. Skyfire reads a behavioral UML diagram (e.g., a state machine diagram), identifies all necessary elements (e.g., transitions) of the diagram, generates effective tests to satisfy various graph coverage criteria, and converts the tests into Cucumber scenarios. Then testers write Cucumber mappings for the generated scenarios. Skyfire does not only generate effective tests but is also completely compatible with the existing agile development and continuous integration (CI) rhythm. We present the design architecture and implementation of skyfire, as well as an industrial case study to show how skyfire is used in practice.",,,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 77952017756}>, <None, {eid: 84983236359}>, <None, {eid: 84934305775}>, <None, {eid: 84983366604}>, <A UML-based approach to system testing, {eid: 84948995039}>, <Automatic test generation: A use case driven approach, {eid: 33645820260}>, <A test automation language framwork for behavioral models, {eid: 84983287973}>, <None, {eid: 84903153672}>, <None, {eid: 84983337695}>, <None, {eid: 84983366620}>, <None, {eid: 84983287989}>, <None, {eid: 84938799121}>, <None, {eid: 3142731744}>, <None, {eid: 85123212227}>, <Better algorithms to minimize the cost of test paths, {eid: 84862321303}>, <None, {eid: 84983325781}>, <None, {eid: 84983255308}>, <None, {eid: 84983246167}>, <None, {eid: 84983246159}>, <Towards automatic scenario generation from coverage information, {eid: 84885007510}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2016-04-10,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-84983329182,True,False,False,False

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components-models may be 'entangled' in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.","Artifical Intelligence, Data, Machine Learning, Process, Software Engineering",,,,,,,,"<Microsoft AI Platform, {eid: 85080663569}>, <Usage and perceptions of agile software development in an industrial context: An exploratory study, {eid: 47949129866}>, <Pair programming: What?s in it for me?, {eid: 62949088997}>, <Have agile techniques been the silver bullet for software development at microsoft?, {eid: 84893262671}>, <DevOps capabilities, practices, and challenges: Insights from a case study, {eid: 85066020410}>, <Maintaining mental models: A study of developer work habits, {eid: 33947315724}>, <The emerging role of data scientists on software development teams, {eid: 84971418613}>, <Data scientists in software teams: State of the art and challenges, {eid: 85030636707}>, <Trials and tribulations of developers of intelligent systems: A field study, {eid: 85000434626}>, <None, {eid: 85080714651}>, <Investigating statistical machine learning as a tool for software development, {eid: 57649217503}>, <None, {eid: 85080729745}>, <The KDD process for extracting useful knowledge from volumes of data, {eid: 0030285403}>, <CRISP-DM: Towards a standard process model for data mining, {eid: 0003157840}>, <How do scientists develop and use scientific software?, {eid: 70349904776}>, <Hardware/software co-design, {eid: 0031101696}>, <Rapid development of multimodal interactive systems: A demonstration of platform for situated intelligence, {eid: 85046681631}>, <Hidden technical debt in machine learning systems, {eid: 84965107309}>, <On human intellect and machine failures: Troubleshooting integrative machine learning systems., {eid: 85030469300}>, <What went wrong and why?

Still, current practices and available integration platforms are too code-oriented. They are not well adapted to work with other, non text-based, software artifacts typically produced during early phases of the software engineering life-cycle. This is especially problematic for teams adopting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach to software development where several (meta)models (and model transformations) are built and executed as part of the development process. Typically, (part of) the code is automatically generated from such models. Therefore, in a complete CD process, changes in a model should trigger changes on the generated code when appropriate. A step further would be to apply CD practices to the development of modeling artefacts themselves. Analogously to “traditional” CD, where the goal is to have the mainline codebase always in a deployable state, the aim would be to have the modeling infrastructure always ready to be used. Those models could be the final product themselves or an intermediate artifact in a complete CSE process as described above. Either way, a tighter integration between CD and MDE would benefit software practitioners by providing them with complete CSE, covering also analysis and design stages of the process.","Continuous delivery, Continuous evolution, Model-driven engineering",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85061088999}>, <Agile software development, {eid: 84862080030}>, <Model-driven continuous deployment for quality DevOps, {eid: 85054816400}>, <None, {eid: 4243422367}>, <None, {eid: 84878326137}>, <None, {eid: 84977560005}>, <None, {eid: 77955162010}>, <Co-evolution of metamodels and models through consistent change propagation, {eid: 84925249904}>, <Automated co-evolution of GMF editor models, {eid: 79952273948}>, <Models@Runtime for continuous design and deployment, {eid: 85028707045}>, <Continuous software engineering: A roadmap and agenda, {eid: 84991441356}>, <Model transformation co-evolution: A semiautomatic approach, {eid: 84872726686}>, <Combining the continuous integration practice and the model-driven engineering approach, {eid: 84981165314}>, <MORSE: A model-aware service environment, {eid: 77949633453}>, <Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation, {eid: 84903601568}>, <EMFStore: A model repository for EMF models, {eid: 77954724460}>, <Merging models with the epsilon merging language (EML), {eid: 33750362774}>, <A framework for composing modular and interoperable model management tasks, {eid: 70350086431}>, <Evolving models in model-driven engineering: State-of-the-art and future challenges, {eid: 84949883493}>, <An infrastructure modelling tool for cloud provisioning, {eid: 85032348388}>, <Presentation of EMF compare utility, {eid: 47749101164}>, <The state of practice in model-driven engineering, {eid: 84899687758}>, <Industrial adoption of model-driven engineering: Are the tools really the problem?, {eid: 84886821083}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,2018-03-05,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85061101819,True,True,False,False

This enables fast and frequent releases in the sense of continuously delivering new iterations of a particular application. Users and customers of today's Web applications and mobile apps running in the Cloud expect fast feedback to problems and feature requests. Thus, it is a critical competitive advantage to be able to respond quickly. Besides cultural and organizational changes that are necessary to apply DevOps in practice, tooling is required to implement end-to-end automation of deployment processes. Automation is the key to efficient collaboration and tight integration between development and operations. The DevOps community is constantly pushing new approaches, tools, and open-source artifacts to implement such automated processes. However, as all these proprietary and heterogeneous DevOps automation approaches differ from each other, it is hard to integrate and combine them to deploy applications in the Cloud using an automated deployment process. In this paper we present a systematic classification of DevOps artifacts and show how different kinds of artifacts can be discovered and transformed toward TOSCA, which is an emerging standard. We present an integrated modeling and runtime framework to enable the seamless and interoperable integration of different approaches to model and deploy application topologies. The framework is implemented by an open-source, end-to-end toolchain. Moreover, we validate and evaluate the presented approach to show its practical feasibility based on a detailed case study, in particular considering the performance of the transformation toward TOSCA.","Cloud computing, Cloud standards, Deployment automation, DevOps, TOSCA, Transformation",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84887309406}>, <None, {eid: 84860316008}>, <None, {eid: 84858197925}>, <None, {eid: 84884493217}>, <None, {eid: 84923681810}>, <None, {eid: 84978418140}>, <None, {eid: 84958809022}>, <Standards-based DevOps automation and integration using TOSCA, {eid: 84946692273}>, <None, {eid: 84941941478}>, <TOSCA: Portable automated deployment and management of cloud applications, {eid: 84930424951}>, <The Emergence of governance in an open source community, {eid: 36749092836}>, <A framework for creating hybrid-open source software communities, {eid: 0036108945}>, <Any2API - Automated APIfication, {eid: 84969848923}>, <Container-based operating system virtualization: A scalable, high-performance alternative to hypervisors, {eid: 34548029519}>, <None, {eid: 84923681808}>, <None, {eid: 84958809023}>, <None, {eid: 84884482931}>, <None, {eid: 84880300218}>, <None, {eid: 84908235036}>, <None, {eid: 78651521953}>, <None, {eid: 77957994724}>, <BPMN4TOSCA: A domain-specific language to model management plans for composite applications, {eid: 84870341884}>, <Automated capturing and systematic usage of DevOps knowledge for cloud applications, {eid: 84944329323}>, <None, {eid: 84944333558}>, <Integrating configuration management with model-driven cloud management based on TOSCA, {eid: 84884491041}>, <None, {eid: 84863232801}>, <None, {eid: 84893925034}>, <Winery - A modeling tool for TOSCA-based cloud applications, {eid: 84892397400}>, <OpenTOSCA - A runtime for TOSCA-based cloud applications, {eid: 84892400015}>, <None, {eid: 58149225100}>, <None, {eid: 0004002692}>, <None, {eid: 84899456507}>, <Combining declarative and imperative cloud application provisioning based on TOSCA, {eid: 84908563698}>, <Unified invocation of scripts and services for provisioning, deployment, and management of cloud applications based on TOSCA, {eid: 84902315977}>, <None, {eid: 84958809025}>, <Blueprinting the Cloud, {eid: 80555156126}>, <None, {eid: 84923681804}>, <None, {eid: 84907080574}>, <Sr DevOpSlang - Bridging the gap between development and operations, {eid: 84923681803}>, <Ubicrawler: A scalable fully distributed web crawler, {eid: 3042680184}>, <Mercator: A scalable, extensible web crawler, {eid: 79951675059}>, <The social compute unit, {eid: 79955550220}>, <The rise of crowdsourcing, {eid: 33847246935}>, <None, {eid: 0344990694}>, <None, {eid: 78651322278}>",,,Elsevier,,,2016-03-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-84958740530,False,True,False,False

From monolithic services, micro-services now cooperate together in ultra-large scale systems.

Container-based technologies (e.g., Docker) emerged recently to tool such deployments, promoting a black-box reuse mechanism to support off-the-shelf deployments. Unfortunately, from the service deployment point of view, such form of black-box reuse prevent to ensure what is really shipped inside the container with the service to deploy. In this paper, we propose a formalism to model and statically analyze service deployment artifacts based on state of the art deployment platforms. The static analysis mechanism leverages the hierarchy of deployment descriptors to verify a given deployment, as well as rewrite it to automatically fix common errors. The approach is validated through the automation of the guidelines provided by the user community associated to the reference Docker engine, and the analysis of 20,000 real deployment descriptors (hosted on GitHub).","Container, Docker, Microservice, Static analysis",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85050513152}>, <Microservices architecture enables DevOps: Migration to a cloud-native architecture, {eid: 84968796741}>, <Detecting model inconsistency through operation-based model construction, {eid: 57349190141}>, <An introduction to docker for reproducible research, {eid: 84930642023}>, <None, {eid: 0003885315}>, <None, {eid: 85025659978}>, <CaDAnCE: A criticality-aware deployment and configuration engine, {eid: 49649124090}>, <DevOps com and clusterhq, {eid: 85050520638}>, <An updated performance comparison of virtual machines and Linux containers, {eid: 84937435024}>, <CloudMF: Applying MDE to tame the complexity of managing multicloud applications, {eid: 84946685259}>, <Deploying on the grid with deployware, {eid: 50649090767}>, <None, {eid: 51749119047}>, <HashiCorp, {eid: 85050565151}>, <None, {eid: 85050541680}>, <None, {eid: 84924414777}>, <Docker: Lightweight linux containers for consistent development and deployment, {eid: 84926444656}>, <Hypervisors vs lightweight virtualization: A performance comparison, {eid: 84944351058}>, <A commutative model composition operator to support software adaptation, {eid: 84864072985}>, <None, {eid: 85010410859}>, <Docker cluster management for the cloud-survey results and own solution, {eid: 84963690007}>, <Linux containers and the future cloud, {eid: 84962848574}>, <None, {eid: 85050525050}>, <None, {eid: 85050572740}>, <A unification algorithm for associative-commutative functions, {eid: 84976741234}>, <Performance evaluation of container-based virtualization for high performance computing environments, {eid: 84877674458}>",,,Association for Computing Machinery,,,2018-04-09,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85050555290,False,False,False,False

The testing phase in the CI systems has timing constraints to ensure software quality without significantly delaying the CI builds. Therefore, CI requires efficient testing techniques such as Test Case Prioritization (TCP) to run faulty test cases with priority. Recent research studies on TCP utilize different Machine Learning (ML) methods to adopt the dynamic and complex nature of CI. However, the performance of ML for TCP may decrease for a low volume of data and less failure rate, whereas using existing data with similar patterns from other domains can be valuable. We formulate this as a transfer learning (TL) problem. TL has proven to be beneficial for many real-world applications where source domains have plenty of data, but the target domains have a scarcity of it. Therefore, this research investigates leveraging the benefit of transfer learning for test case prioritization (TCP). However, only some industrial CI datasets are publicly available due to data privacy protection regulations. In such cases, model-based transfer learning is a potential solution to share knowledge among different projects without revealing data to other stakeholders. This paper applies TransBoost, a tree-kernel-based TL algorithm, to evaluate the TL approach for 24 study subjects and identify potential source datasets.","Continuous Integration (CI), Test Case Prioritization (TCP), Transfer Learning (TL)",,,,,,,,"<Techniques for improving regression testing in continuous integration development environments, {eid: 84986877429}>, <Test case prioritization: A family of empirical studies, {eid: 0036472965}>, <Test cases prioritization using open dependency structure algorithm, {eid: 84938909933}>, <Empirically evaluating readily available information for regression test optimization in continuous integration, {eid: 85111442372}>, <Rtptorrent: An open-source dataset for evaluating regression test prioritization, {eid: 85088915265}>, <Transfer learning for automated test case prioritization using xcsf, {eid: 85107515532}>, <None, {eid: 85089600740}>, <Transboost: A boosting-tree kernel transfer learning algorithm for improving financial inclusion, {eid: 85147607385}>, <Learning to rank for information retrieval and natural language processing, {eid: 84943760329}>, <Learning-to-rank vs ranking-to-learn: Strategies for regression testing in continuous integration, {eid: 85094318353}>, <Systemlevel test case prioritization using machine learning, {eid: 85015360836}>, <Using the case-based ranking methodology for test case prioritization, {eid: 34547244888}>, <Optimizing search engines using clickthrough data, {eid: 0242456822}>, <Learning for test prioritization: An industrial case study, {eid: 84997235107}>, <Optimizing test prioritization via test distribution analysis, {eid: 85058263302}>, <Recurrent neural network for web services performance forecasting, ranking and regression testing, {eid: 85082392258}>, <Incorporating fault-proneness estimations into coverage-based test case prioritization methods, {eid: 85079054649}>, <Test case design and test case prioritization using machine learning, {eid: 85074628474}>, <An empirical study on bayesian networkbased approach for test case prioritization, {eid: 50649115541}>, <Studying test case failure prediction for test case prioritization, {eid: 85053197930}>, <An improvement to test case failure prediction in the context of test case prioritization, {eid: 85056719436}>, <Machine learning based test case prioritization in object oriented testing, {eid: 85073755471}>, <A framework for continuous regression and integration testing in iot systems based on deep learning and search-based techniques, {eid: 85097184092}>, <Reinforcement learning for automatic test case prioritization and selection in continuous integration, {eid: 85026639599}>, <Reinforcement learning for test case prioritization, {eid: 85135266050}>, <Test case selection and prioritization using machine learning: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85121144062}>, <Test re-prioritization in continuous testing environments, {eid: 85058303599}>, <Redefining prioritization: continuous prioritization for continuous integration, {eid: 85049407641}>, <Continuous test suite failure prediction, {eid: 85111456523}>, <Reinforcement learning based test case prioritization for enhancing the security of software, {eid: 85098011611}>, <A clustering approach to improving test case prioritization: An industrial case study, {eid: 83455213915}>, <Xcs as a reinforcement learning approach to automatic test case prioritization, {eid: 85089750472}>, <Prioritizing test cases for regression testing, {eid: 0034592889}>, <None, {eid: 85070701944}>, <Application of transfer learning for object detection on manually collected data, {eid: 85072822759}>, <Fastlane: Test minimization for rapidly deployed large-scale online services, {eid: 85072284134}>, <Combinatorial interaction regression testing: A study of test case generation and prioritization, {eid: 47349111813}>, <Machine learning regression techniques for test case prioritization in continuous integration environment, {eid: 85135774956}>, <None, {eid: 85165984191}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2023-05-15,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85165992019,False,False,True,False

All rights reserved.Context: Testing complex industrial robots (CIRs) requires testing several interacting control systems. This is challenging, especially for robots performing process-intensive tasks such as painting or gluing, since their dedicated process control systems can be loosely coupled with the robot's motion control. Objective: Current practices for validating CIRs involve manual test case design and execution. To reduce testing costs and improve quality assurance, a trend is to automate the generation of test cases. Our work aims to define a cost-effective automated testing technique to validate CIR control systems in an industrial context. Method: This paper reports on a methodology, developed at ABB Robotics in collaboration with SIMULA, for the fully automated testing of CIRs control systems. Our approach draws on continuous integration principles and well-established constraint-based testing techniques. It is based on a novel constraintbased model for automatically generating test sequences where test sequences are both generated and executed as part of a continuous integration process. Results: By performing a detailed analysis of experimental results over a simplified version of our constraint model, we determine the most appropriate parameterization of the operational version of the constraint model. This version is now being deployed at ABB Robotics's CIR testing facilities and used on a permanent basis. This paper presents the empirical results obtained when automatically generating test sequences for CIRs at ABB Robotics. In a real industrial setting, the results show that our methodology is not only able to detect reintroduced known faults, but also to spot completely new faults. Conclusion: Our empirical evaluation shows that constraint-based testing is appropriate for automatically generating test sequences for CIRs and can be faithfully deployed in an industrial context.","Agile development, Constraint programming, Continuous integration, Distributed real time systems, Robotized painting, Software testing",,,,,,,,"<Test generation for robotized paint systems using constraint programming in a continuous integration environment, {eid: 84883352915}>, <None, {eid: 0003426802}>, <None, {eid: 0006705483}>, <Continuous software engineering and beyond: Trends and challenges, {eid: 84942514935}>, <Communicating continuous integration servers for increasing effectiveness of automated testing, {eid: 84866917846}>, <Software testing: A research travelogue 2000-2014, {eid: 84942057973}>, <Empirical studies of test case prioritization in a JUnit testing environment, {eid: 16244385003}>, <A new heuristic for test suite reduction, {eid: 0032115945}>, <Test case prioritization for continuous regression testing: An industrial case study, {eid: 84891715780}>, <Unit test virtualization with vmvm, {eid: 84994138689}>, <On-demand test suite reduction, {eid: 84864269921}>, <CiCUTS: Combining system execution modeling tools with continuous integration environments, {eid: 44149100080}>, <A programming model for time-synchronized distributed real-time systems, {eid: 34548134817}>, <The control of discrete event systems, {eid: 0024479313}>, <None, {eid: 84892236938}>, <Ieee-1588 standard for a precision clock synchronization protocol for networked measurement and control systems, {eid: 4544372422}>, <Time synchronization in a local area network, {eid: 1842680834}>, <Cyber-physical systems: The next computing revolution, {eid: 77956217277}>, <Cyber-physical systems: A new frontier, {eid: 84892198803}>, <Cyber physical systems: Design challenges, {eid: 49649119406}>, <Crosslayer analysis testing and verification of automotive control software, {eid: 80455179700}>, <None, {eid: 85013703606}>, <Specification and verification: The spec# experience, {eid: 79959994169}>, <Automatic test data generation using constraint solving techniques, {eid: 84951817396}>, <Test selection strategies for lustre descriptions in gatel, {eid: 11244264152}>, <Stress testing of task deadlines: A constraint programming approach, {eid: 84893212634}>, <Goal-oriented test data generation for pointer programs, {eid: 34347374293}>, <Stress testing of task deadlines: A constraint programming approach, {eid: 84893212634}>, <Test architectures for testing distributed systems, {eid: 57349196017}>, <None, {eid: 84922566253}>, <Python reference manual, {eid: 0013153953}>, <A taxonomy of model-based testing approaches, {eid: 84862325128}>, <None, {eid: 0003683967}>, <None, {eid: 33748706709}>, <Z3: An efficient SMT solver, {eid: 45749085681}>, <Search-based software test data generation: A survey, {eid: 3142725712}>, <None, {eid: 82955189952}>, <An open-ended finite domain constraint solver, {eid: 84923057783}>, <Optimisation modelling for software developers, {eid: 84868266728}>, <The future of optimization technology, {eid: 84902474528}>",,,Elsevier B.V.,,,2015-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-84922513915,True,False,True,False

CPSs with this feature are named Self-Healing CPSs (SH-CPSs). SH-CPSs detect and recover from errors caused by hardware or software faults at runtime and handle uncertainties arising from their interactions with environments. Therefore, it is critical to test if SH-CPSs can still behave as expected under uncertainties. By testing an SH-CPS in various conditions and learning from testing results, reinforcement learning algorithms can gradually optimize their testing policies and apply the policies to detect failures, i.e., cases that the SH-CPS fails to behave as expected. However, there is insufficient evidence to know which reinforcement learning algorithms perform the best in terms of testing SH-CPSs behaviors including their self-healing behaviors under uncertainties. To this end, we conducted an empirical study to evaluate the performance of 14 combinations of reinforcement learning algorithms, with two value function learning based methods for operation invocations and seven policy optimization based algorithms for introducing uncertainties. Experimental results reveal that the 14 combinations of the algorithms achieved similar coverage of system states and transitions, and the combination of Q-learning and Uncertainty Policy Optimization (UPO) detected the most failures among the 14 combinations. On average, the Q-Learning and UPO combination managed to discover two times more failures than the others. Meanwhile, the combination took 52% less time to find a failure. Regarding scalability, the time and space costs of the value function learning based methods grow, as the number of states and transitions of the system under test increases. In contrast, increasing the system’s complexity has little impact on policy optimization based algorithms.","Cyber-physical systems, Empirical evaluation, Model execution, Reinforcement learning, Self-healing, Uncertainty",,,,,,,,"<Generating test data from OCL constraints with search techniques, {eid: 84884878316, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2013.17}>, <None, {eid: 85042614022}>, <Controlling the false discovery rate: A practical and powerful approach to multiple testing, {eid: 0001677717}>, <Model-based fault diagnosis and reconfiguration of robot drives, {eid: 51349162241}>, <Model-based hypothesis testing of uncertain software systems, {eid: 85079042885}>, <Automated test sequence generation for finite state machines using genetic algorithms, {eid: 52249113028}>, <Benchmarking Deep Reinforcement Learning for Continuous Control, {eid: 85019241632}>, <Multiple comparisons using rank sums, {eid: 84861604521, doi: 10.1080/00401706.1964.10490181}>, <Lightweight automated testing with adaptation-based programming, 2012 IEEE 23rd international symposium on software reliability engineering, {eid: 84876394399, doi: 10.1109/ISSRE.2012.1}>, <Safety and dependability analysis of self-adaptive systems, second international symposium on leveraging applications of formal methods, {eid: 77956422483}>, <Deep reinforcement learning that matters.

It is important to test whether self-healing behaviors can correctly heal faults under uncertainties to ensure their reliability. However, the autonomy of self-healing behaviors and impact of uncertainties make it challenging to conduct such testing. To this end, we devise a fragility-oriented testing approach, which is comprised of two novel algorithms: fragility-oriented testing (FOT) and uncertainty policy optimization (UPO). The two algorithms utilize the fragility, obtained from test executions, to learn the optimal policies for invoking operations and introducing uncertainties, respectively, to effectively detect faults. We evaluated their performance by comparing them against a coverage-oriented testing (COT) algorithm and a random uncertainty generation method (R). The evaluation results showed that the fault detection ability of FOT+UPO was significantly higher than the ones of FOT+R, COT+UPO, and COT+R, in 73 out of 81 cases. In the 73 cases, FOT+UPO detected more than 70% of faults, while the others detected 17% of faults, at the most.","Cyber-physical systems, Model execution, Reinforcement learning, Self-healing, Uncertainty",,,,,,,,"<Generating test data from OCL constraints with search techniques, {eid: 84884878316, doi: 10.1109/TSE.2013.17}>, <None, {eid: 0003844191}>, <Intelligent agent-based stimulation for testing robotic software in human-robot interactions, {eid: 85030683872}>, <A practical guide for using statistical tests to assess randomized algorithms in software engineering, {eid: 79959871222}>, <None, {eid: 0003655704}>, <None, {eid: 85042614022}>, <A survey on testing for cyber physical system, {eid: 84952786814}>, <Software engineering for smart cyber-physical systems--towards a research agenda: report on the First International Workshop on Software Engineering for Smart CPS, {eid: 84993962773, doi: 10.1145/2830719.2830736}>, <On-the-fly conformance testing using SPIN, {eid: 84896693311, doi: 10.1007/s100090050044}>, <Model and object verification by using Dresden OCL, {eid: 79951889367}>, <Benchmarking deep reinforcement learning for continuous control, {eid: 85019241632}>, <A controlled experiment in testing of safety-critical embedded software, {eid: 84983326093}>, <Uncertainty in self-adaptive software systems, {eid: 84883580334}>, <Towards run-time adaptation of test cases for self-adaptive systems in the face of uncertainty, {eid: 84903746086}>, <Importance sampling for stochastic simulations, {eid: 0001240715, doi: 10.1287/mnsc.35.11.1367}>, <Model-based testing in practice, {eid: 85054050987}>, <Lightweight automated testing with adaptation-based programming, {eid: 84876394399}>, <Methods of conjugate gradients for solving linear systems, {eid: 0000135303, doi: 10.6028/jres.049.044}>, <Reinforcement learning: a survey, {eid: 0029679044, doi: 10.1613/jair.301}>, <Approximately optimal approximate reinforcement learning, {eid: 1942514728}>, <Online testing of real-time systems using uppaal, {eid: 67349165874}>, <None, {eid: 85029416652}>, <Fragility-oriented testing with model execution and reinforcement learning, {eid: 85030696798}>, <Modeling foundations for executable model-based testing of self-healing cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85068943818}>, <None, {eid: 0003830923}>, <A taxonomy of uncertainty for dynamically adaptive systems, {eid: 84865127075}>, <Trust region policy optimization, {eid: 84969963490}>, <Current challenges in the verification of hybrid systems, {eid: 84952657055}>, <None, {eid: 0004102479}>, <Moka–a simulation platform for Papyrus based on OMG specifications for executable UML, {eid: 85057527028}>, <A taxonomy of model-based testing approaches, {eid: 84862325128, doi: 10.1002/stvr.456}>, <Online testing with reinforcement learning, {eid: 43049140624}>, <None, {eid: 84949178783, doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-29044-2}>, <Verifying self-adaptive applications suffering uncertainty, {eid: 84908608579}>, <None, {eid: 0004312284}>, <Understanding uncertainty in cyber-physical systems: A conceptual model, {eid: 85063200977}>, <None, {eid: 85014574153}>, <Verification and validation in cyber physical systems: Research challenges and a way forward, {eid: 84946222990}>",,,Springer New York LLC,,,2019-01-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85063237133,False,False,False,False

We need several tools for modeling, deployment, control, and analytics to test and evaluate uncertainties for different configurations of the same CPS. In this paper, we explain why using state-of-the art model-driven engineering (MDE) and model-based testing (MBT) tools is not adequate for testing uncertainties of CPS in IoT Cloud infrastructures.

Test-driven development (TDD) of software systems has been successfully used for agile development of business software systems. Test cases guide the system implementation and can be executed automatically after software changes (continuous integration & build strategy). However, TDD processes need to be adapted to control automation systems engineering, where real-world systems are challenging to model and to test automatically. In this paper we introduce an adapted TDD process from the business software engineering domain to industrial automation engineering. We identify a set of UML models that enable the systematic derivation of test cases. Based on an initial empirical study we evaluate the adapted TDD process based on an industrial use case to identify strength and limitation of this approach.

Therefore, the need for applying agile development practices in the model-based design of CPS is becoming more widespread. This is no easy feat, as CPS are inherently complex, and their model-based development is less suited for agile development. Model-based development does suit the concept of digital twin, that is, design models representing a system instance in operation. In this paper we present an approach where the digital twins of system instances serve as a common-knowledge base for the entire agile development cycle of the system when performing system updates. Doing so enables interesting possibilities, such as the identification and detection of system variants, which is beneficial for the verification and validation of the system update. It also brings along challenges, as the executable physics based digital twin is generally computationally expensive. In this paper we introduce this approach by means of a small example of a swiveling pick and place robotic arm. We also elaborate on related work, and open future challenges.","Cyber-physical system, DevOps, Digital twin",,,,,,,,"<Valid (Re-)use of models-of-the-physics in cyber-physical systems using validity frames, {eid: 85068596867}>, <The functional mockup interface for tool independent exchange of simulation models, {eid: 84871289819}>, <None, {eid: 85115114425}>, <None, {eid: 85115177356}>, <Towards agile model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85041433552}>, <None, {eid: 84881132720}>, <Continuous integration for embedded systems using simulation, {eid: 85047541283}>, <None, {eid: 85104801535}>, <None, {eid: 85115131147}>, <None, {eid: 85016450943}>, <Virtual test environment for efficient verification of software updates for variant-rich automotive systems, {eid: 85073159022}>, <The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations, {eid: 85056895078}>, <None, {eid: 85115186825}>, <Leveraging digital twin technology in model-based systems engineering, {eid: 85111581098}>, <Digital twins for continuous deployment in model-based systems engineering of cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85102746191}>, <None, {eid: 85115131147}>, <Validity frame concept as effort-cutting technique within the verification and validation of complex cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85096774246}>, <None, {eid: 85144595929}>, <An introduction to multi-paradigm modelling and simulation, {eid: 0012303245}>, <Continuous deployment for dependable systems with continuous assurance cases, {eid: 85080908823}>, <An industrial roadmap for continuous delivery of software for safety-critical systems, {eid: 85108593963}>",,,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,,,2021-09-07,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85115129760,False,False,False,False

Traditional approaches cover individual aspects, like data exchange formats and published interfaces. They may adhere to some standard, however they hardly cover the production of the integration layer, which is implemented as bespoke glue code that is hard to produce and even harder to maintain. Therefore, the traditional integration approach often leads to poor code quality, further increasing the time and cost and reducing the agility, and a high reliance on the individual development skills. We are instead tackling the interoperability challenge by building a model driven/low-code Digital Thread platform that 1) systematizes the integration methodology, 2) provides methods and techniques for the individual integrations based on a layered Domain Specific Languages (DSL) approach, 3) through the DSLs it covers the integration space domain by domain, technology by technology, and is thus highly generalizable and reusable, 4) showcases a first collection of examples from the domains of robotics, IoT, data analytics, AI/ML and web applications, 5) brings cohesiveness to the aforementioned heterogeneous platform, and 6) is easier to understand and maintain, even by not specialized programmers. We showcase the power, versatility and the potential of the Digital Thread platform on four interoperability case studies: the generic extension to REST services, to robotics through the UR family of robots, to the integration of various external databases (for data integration) and to the provision of data analytics capabilities in R.","Digital Thread (DT), Interoperability, Low Code Development

Unfortunately, learning such global behaviors can be inaccurate and slow for systems composed of heterogeneous elements, which behave very differently, for instance as it is the case for cyber-physical systems and Internet of Things applications. Instead, to make smart decisions, such systems have to continuously refine the behavior on a per-element basis and compose these small learning units together. However, combining and composing learned behaviors from different elements is challenging and requires domain knowledge. Therefore, there is a need to structure and combine the learned behaviors and domain knowledge together in a flexible way. In this paper we propose to weave machine learning into domain modeling. More specifically, we suggest to decompose machine learning into reusable, chainable, and independently computable small learning units, which we refer to as microlearning units. These microlearning units are modeled together with and at the same level as the domain data. We show, based on a smart grid case study, that our approach can be significantly more accurate than learning a global behavior, while the performance is fast enough to be used for live learning.","Cyber-physical systems, Domain modeling, Live learning, Metamodeling, Model-driven engineering, Smart grids",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84958264664}>, <A survey of context modelling and reasoning techniques, {eid: 77950189737, doi: 10.1016/j.pmcj.2009.06.002}>, <MOA: massive online analysis, {eid: 77953527363}>, <Model-based machine learning, {eid: 84874128594, doi: 10.1098/rsta.2012.0222}>, <None, {eid: 14944348412}>, <Hadoop hbase-0.20. 2 performance evaluation, {eid: 77957816388}>, <The entity-relationship model—toward a unified view of data, {eid: 84976766949, doi: 10.1145/320434.320440}>, <Predicting delays in software projects using networked classification, {eid: 84963900777}>, <None, {eid: 84882724288}>, <Mining high-speed data streams, {eid: 0034592938, doi: 10.1145/347090.347107}>, <Data classification using support vector machine, {eid: 78650217306}>, <Principles of proper validation: use and abuse of re-sampling for validation, {eid: 77951028114, doi: 10.1002/cem.1310}>, <Coarse- and fine-grained sentiment analysis of social media text, {eid: 79960220439}>, <Kevoree modeling framework (KMF): Efficient modeling techniques for runtime use, {eid: 84939477245}>, <Direct bulk-synchronous parallel algorithms, {eid: 0002546016, doi: 10.1006/jpdc.1994.1085}>, <None, {eid: 85064020103}>, <The WEKA data mining software: an update, {eid: 76749092270, doi: 10.1145/1656274.1656278}>, <Chronos: A graph engine for temporal graph analysis, {eid: 84900444277, doi: 10.1145/2592798.2592799}>, <Generating realistic smart grid communication topologies based on real-data, {eid: 84922444255, doi: 10.1109/SmartGridComm.2014.7007684}>, <A native versioning concept to support historized models at runtime, {eid: 84921744519, doi: 10.1007/978-3-319-11653-2_16}>, <Reasoning at runtime using time-distorted contexts: A models@run.time based approach, {eid: 84922459287}>, <Stream my models: Reactive peer-to-peer distributed models@run.time, {eid: 84961621637, doi: 10.1109/MODELS.2015.7338238}>, <Suspicious electric consumption detection based on multi-profiling using live machine learning, {eid: 84964989120}>, <Modeling context information in pervasive computing systems, {eid: 84958964894}>, <Evaluating collaborative filtering recommender systems, {eid: 3042697346, doi: 10.1145/963770.963772}>, <Jubatus: An open source platform for distributed online machine learning, {eid: 84927659398}>, <Microlearning: Emerging concepts, practices and technologies after e-learning, {eid: 84865065271}>, <Model driven engineering, {eid: 84944183958}>, <None, {eid: 85064020994}>, <None, {eid: 0003449831}>, <Distributed graphlab: a framework for machine learning and data mining in the cloud, {eid: 84863735533, doi: 10.14778/2212351.2212354}>, <Graphlab: A new framework for parallel machine learning, {eid: 85014817262}>, <None, {eid: 85064019685}>, <Internet of things: vision, applications and research challenges, {eid: 84861997111, doi: 10.1016/j.adhoc.2012.02.016}>, <None, {eid: 85055776871}>, <Models@run.time to support dynamic adaptation, {eid: 70350345225, doi: 10.1109/MC.2009.327}>, <Artificial Intelligence, {eid: 85064016202}>, <None, {eid: 85064018805}>, <Behavioral resource-aware model inference, {eid: 84908657625}>, <Making sense of business process descriptions: an experimental comparison of graphical and textual notations, {eid: 84857366249, doi: 10.1016/j.jss.2011.09.023}>, <Artificial intelligence, simulation and modeling, {eid: 0002434033}>, <Graphscope: Parameter-free mining of large time-evolving graphs, {eid: 36849035825, doi: 10.1145/1281192.1281266}>, <Requirements elicitation: Towards the unknown unknowns, {eid: 84891141749}>, <Developing a DSL-based approach for event-based monitoring of systems of systems: Experiences and lessons learned, {eid: 84963930783}>, <None, {eid: 73649104640}>, <Machine learning in medical imaging, {eid: 85032751398, doi: 10.1109/MSP.2010.936730}>, <T-finder: a recommender system for finding passengers and vacant taxis, {eid: 84883294122, doi: 10.1109/TKDE.2012.153}>, <Multi-granular representation-the key to machine intelligence, {eid: 85040568671, doi: 10.1109/ISKE.2008.4730887}>, <Multi-granular representation-the key to machine intelligence, {eid: 85040568671}>, <Formal descriptive semantics of uml and its applications, {eid: 78649576304}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,2019-04-04,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85019693871,False,False,True,True

Thus, quantum applications will be more and more integrated in classical applications. To bring these composite applications into production, technologies for an automated deployment and orchestration are required to avoid manual error-prone and time-consuming processes. For non-quantum applications, a variety of deployment technologies have been developed in recent years. However, the deployment of quantum applications currently differs significantly from non-quantum applications and thus, leads to a different modeling procedure for the deployment of quantum applications. To overcome these problems, we propose TOSCA4QC that introduces two deployment modeling styles based on the Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) standard for automating the deployment and orchestration of quantum applications: (i) SDK-specific modeling style to cover all technical deployment details and (ii) SDK-Agnostic modeling style supporting common modeling principles.

Due to this high complexity that exists when provisioning test environments within the multiple available cloud platforms, it is necessary to make a significant investment in human resources, like time and effort for the implementation and execution of testing. There is additional complexity: testing software in a single environment is no longer sufficient. Today's mobile industry is constantly growing, and execution environments tend to be always different; the hardware configuration is usually different and sometimes exceeds the software barrier. It is challenging to execute testing on each of the existing devices, as this requires a long task of human intervention. Today some platforms provide testing services in different environments. However, not all providers have the complete set of environments that one would like to have, and specific knowledge is mandatory for using each available tool. It is a task that requires expertise and time. This work seeks to mitigate the impact on time and the learning curve through a high-level tool developed using a model-oriented approach, thus reducing the time needed for setting up each required platform for organizations. As a solution, we propose a Domain-Specific Language for provisioning multiple cloud testing environments for mobile applications. The configuration of the environment is done with the Domain Specific Language to make the usage easier by the final user. The necessary code is generated through transformations to set up an environment on cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This usage of this platform results in fewer code lines written and less time learning about the specific knowledge for each platform.","cloud, DevOPS, DSL, mobile, testing",,,,,,,,"<A systematic mapping study addressing the reliability of mobile applications: The need to move beyond testing reliability, {eid: 85121658690}>, <Review paper on various software testing techniques and strategies, {eid: 85097548924}>, <Developing mobile applications via model driven development: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85112044746}>, <Checking app behavior against app descriptions: What if there are no app descriptions?, {eid: 85112056079}>, <None, {eid: 85151337914}>, <Tracking for mobile devices: A systematic mapping study, {eid: 84962519405}>, <Vision: Improved development of mobile ehealth applications, {eid: 85051662042}>, <Validation of architectural requirements for tackling cloud computing barriers: Cloud provider perspective, {eid: 85105617772}>, <Serverless execution of scientific workflows: Experiments with hyperflow, aws lambda and google cloud functions, {eid: 85035082302}>, <Streamlining devops automation for cloud applications using tosca as standardized metamodel, {eid: 84958740530}>, <Response time evaluation of mobile applications combining network protocol analysis and information fusion, {eid: 85123008106}>, <Continuous benchmarking: Using system benchmarking in build pipelines, {eid: 85071486300}>, <Continuous testing and solutions for testing problems in continuous delivery: A systematic literature review, {eid: 85055587228}>, <Appflow: Using machine learning to synthesize robust, reusable ui tests, {eid: 85058288795}>, <What will it take? a view on adoption of model-based methods in practice, {eid: 84867900536}>, <None, {eid: 85133664838}>, <None, {eid: 85151317339}>, <None, {eid: 85140296427}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-11-08,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85151342791,False,False,False,False

There is an urgent need to provide modelers with better, more Intelligent Modeling Assistants (IMAs). An important factor to consider is the ability to assess and compare, to learn from existing and inform future IMAs, while potentially combining them. Recently, a conceptual Reference Framework for Intelligent Modeling Assistance (RF-IMA) was proposed. RF-IMA defines the main required components and high-level properties of IMAs. In this paper, we present a detailed, level-wise definition for the properties of RF-IMA to enable a better understanding, comparison, and selection of existing and future IMAs. The proposed levels are a first step towards a comprehensive assessment grid for intelligent modeling assistance. For an initial validation of the proposed levels, we assess the existing landscape of intelligent modeling assistance and three future scenarios of intelligent modeling assistance against these levels.","Artificial intelligence, Assessment levels, Feedback, Integrated development environment, Intelligent modeling assistance, Model-based software engineering",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85096770105}>, <None, {eid: 85096745967}>, <None, {eid: 85096770189}>, <Harmonization and categorization of metrics and criteria for evaluation of recommender systems in healthcare from dual perspectives, {eid: 85074342440}>, <Domore-A recommender system for domain modeling, {eid: 85052025506}>, <Development of a tool for measuring and analyzing computer user satisfaction, {eid: 0020749247}>, <Feature extraction approaches from natural language requirements for reuse in software product lines: A systematic literature review, {eid: 84930795477}>, <Multi-step learning and adaptive search for learning complex model transformations from examples, {eid: 84975316777}>, <The probability of timeliness of a fully connected exchange in a redundant real-time communication system, {eid: 85088584840}>, <Grand challenges in model-driven engineering: An analysis of the state of the research, {eid: 85077634676}>, <Expressing confidence in models and in model transformation elements, {eid: 85056905500}>, <An lstm-based neural network architecture for model transformations, {eid: 85076107429}>, <Belief uncertainty in software models, {eid: 85074883882}>, <TEAN: Timeliness enhanced attention network for session-based recommendation, {eid: 85087275814}>, <A hitchhikers guide to model-driven engineering for data-centric systems, {eid: 85085080142}>, <An UML class recommender system for software design, {eid: 85022041165}>, <Timeliness Measurement Model: A mathematical approach for measuring the timeliness of handheld application usage, {eid: 85018337831}>, <Process model generation from natural language text, {eid: 79960335582}>, <Non-human modelers: Challenges and roadmap for reusable self-explanation, {eid: 85042680029}>, <The next evolution of mde: A seamless integration of machine learning into domain modeling, {eid: 85040582253}>, <Class diagram extraction from textual requirements using natural language processing (nlp) techniques, {eid: 77955200725}>, <Towards model-driven sustainability evaluation, {eid: 85080891648}>, <Recommender system for model driven software development, {eid: 85030768868}>, <Defining quality aspects for conceptual models, {eid: 2442599587}>, <Pattern-based auto-completion of uml modeling activities, {eid: 84908611338}>, <None, {eid: 0004276920}>, <Understanding quality in conceptual modeling, {eid: 0028396177}>, <None, {eid: 84921662598}>, <Expert voice: Opportunities in intelligent modeling assistance, {eid: 85088027792}>, <Humans and automation: Use, misuse, disuse, abuse, {eid: 0031171736}>, <Towards automating the synthesis of chatbots for conversational model query, {eid: 85088020707}>, <Collaborative modeling and group decision making using chatbots in social networks, {eid: 85049777217}>, <How far you can get using machine learning black-boxes, {eid: 79952852833}>, <None, {eid: 84968875300}>, <Towards domain-specific model editors with automatic model completion, {eid: 76349083874}>, <Improving the timeliness of bluetooth low energy in dynamic rf environments, {eid: 85096807803}>, <Ucda: Use case driven development assistant tool for class model generation, {eid: 59849121184}>, <None, {eid: 78649516976}>, <The state of practice in model-driven engineering, {eid: 84899687758}>, <Empirical validation of website timeliness measures, {eid: 34248564908}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2020-10-16,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096779067,False,False,False,True

The existing DevOps integration platforms, e.g., Keptn, often employ a family of languages for this purpose. However, as we have learnt from UML, SysML, and many others, a family of languages requires inter-model constraints to be checked in order to guarantee a high consistency between the different artefacts.In this work-in-progress paper, we propose a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach for the continuous consistency checking of DevOps artefacts. First, we explicitly represent each artefact as a model, second, we establish links across them to set a navigable network of model elements; and third, we enable MDE services on top of this network.We envision the possibility of using GitOps to pull the DevOps artefacts, executing services for checking consistency and performing model repairs, uploading the changes to the DevOps tools, and finally pushing the artefacts to Git, thus resulting in a continuous consistency checking process in practice.","consistency management, DevOps, MDE",,,,,,,,"<What is devops?

At model-level we have integrated the developed domain-specific tool in the continuous delivery pipeline for the computed tomography software and thereby bring the Continuous Delivery mind-set with advantages and challenges to domain experts who are working traditionally 'outside' of the software development.","Continuous delivery, ""Jetbrains MPS"", Model-driven engineering",,,,,,,,"<Taming the software development complexity with domain specific languages, {eid: 85075930625}>, <Automated testing of DSL implementations-experiences from building mbeddr, {eid: 85031933140}>, <A qualitative study of devops usage in practice, {eid: 85021358087}>, <Devops in regulated software development: Case medical devices, {eid: 85026751442}>, <Transition towards continuous delivery in the healthcare domain, {eid: 85072122314}>, <None, {eid: 85075945181}>, <Combining the continuous integration practice and the model-driven engineering approach, {eid: 84981165314}>, <Impediments to introducing continuous integration for model-based development in industry, {eid: 85075941988}>, <Stepwise adoption of continuous delivery in model-driven engineering, {eid: 85061101819}>, <Lessons learned from developing mbeddr: A case study in language engineering with mps, {eid: 85062054290}>, <Using C language extensions for developing embedded software: A case study, {eid: 84958628004}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-09-15,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85075924980,True,False,False,False

Parallel to Model-based methods, other paradigms are similarly maturing and being integrated, and one such paradigm is DevOps. Model-based methods and DevOps are perceived to provide benefits when viewed in isolation. Recently, there has been an increased interest in matching the two paradigms, with various proposals and early adoption results. However, little focus is put on the practitioners' view. In this paper, we propose a methodology that aims to utilise Model-driven engineering and DevOps practices in conjunction. Together with the methodology, we present an early evaluation of it from a practitioner's perspective. In particular, we study a large and long-running student project aiming to build a solar vehicle, by presenting the current integration and potential future directions. In this paper we limit the observation to the development phase. Early feedback from the case study indicates significant benefits for several identified project pain points, and it's expected that more benefits will emerge when more advanced DevOps aspects are integrated with model-based methods, and the project matures.","DevOps, model-based engineering, practitioners, simulink",,,,,,,,"<User Experience for Model-Driven Engineering: Challenges and Future Directions, {eid: 85040569509}>, <Early validation of heterogeneous battery systems in the railway domain, {eid: 85130823867}>, <Towards modeling framework for devops: Requirements derived from industry use case, {eid: 85079101956}>, <Model-driven software engineering in practice, {eid: 84878326137}>, <Grand challenges in model-driven engineering: An analysis of the state of the research, {eid: 85077634676}>, <Experiences of teaching model-driven engineering in a software design course, {eid: 85026650015}>, <DevopsML: Towards modeling devops processes and platforms, {eid: 85096806448}>, <Towards a model-based devops for cyber-physical systems, {eid: 85096956543}>, <Systems engineering challenges and MBSE opportunities for automotive system design, {eid: 85044377052}>, <Challenges and best practices in industry-Academia collaborations in software engineering: A systematic literature review, {eid: 84980410074}>, <Descriptive vs Prescriptive Models in Industry, {eid: 85008425440}>, <What is DevOps A systematic mapping study on definitions and practices, {eid: 85019409567}>, <Consistency management in industrial continuous model-based development settings: A reality check, {eid: 85142933274}>, <Adopting DevOps in the real world: A theory, a model, and a case study, {eid: 85070228584}>, <The systems engineering DevOps lemniscate and model-based system operations, {eid: 85130822811}>, <MDE adoption in industry: Challenges and success criteria, {eid: 67650136136}>, <DevOps adoption benefits and challenges in practice: A case study, {eid: 84998953411}>, <Continuous integration, delivery and deployment: A systematic review on approaches, tools, challenges and practices, {eid: 85019140530}>, <Adopting MBSE in construction equipment industry: An experience report, {eid: 85066815769}>, <Using DevOps toolchains in Agile model-driven engineering, {eid: 85142922086}>, <INCOSE systems engineering handbook version 4: Updating the reference for practitioners, {eid: 85166328746}>, <Industrial adoption of model-driven engineering: Are the tools really the problem, {eid: 84886821083}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2022-10-23,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85142926746,True,True,False,False

[Question/problem] However, current research on data-driven RE focuses more on leveraging certain techniques such as natural language processing or machine learning than on making the concept fit for facilitating its use in the entire software development process. [Principal ideas/results] In this paper, we propose a research agenda composed of six distinct research directions. These include a data-driven RE infrastructure, embracing data heterogeneity, context-aware adaptation, data analysis and decision support, privacy and confidentiality, and finally process integration. Each of these directions addresses challenges that impede the broader use of data-driven RE. [Contribution] For researchers, our research agenda provides topics relevant to investigate. For practitioners, overcoming the underlying challenges with the help of the proposed research will allow to adopt a data-driven RE approach and facilitate its seamless integration into modern software engineering. For users, the proposed research will enable the transparency, control, and security needed to trust software systems and software providers.","Data-driven requirements engineering, Feedback gathering, Model-driven Engineering, Requirements monitoring",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 84878326137}>, <3LConOnt: A three-level ontology for context modelling in context-aware computing, {eid: 85027518520}>, <None, {eid: 85064059329}>, <Data science: technologies for better software, {eid: 85074196089}>, <How can quality awareness support rapid software development? – a research preview, {eid: 85013935704}>, <The brave new world of design requirements, {eid: 79958086098}>, <How do practitioners capture and utilize user feedback during continuous software engineering?, {eid: 85076916687}>, <Raising the odds of success: The current state of experimentation in product development, {eid: 84964692724}>, <Toward data-driven requirements engineering, {eid: 84971524522}>, <Data-driven requirements engineering: An update, {eid: 85072125118}>, <Continuously assessing and improving software quality with software analytics tools: A case study, {eid: 85067226210}>, <FAME: Supporting continuous requirements elicitation by combining user feedback and monitoring, {eid: 85056819919}>, <None, {eid: 85083975397}>, <The interplay of design and runtime traceability for non-functional requirements, {eid: 85073000295}>, <Ubiquitous requirements engineering: A paradigm shift that affects everyone, {eid: 85062173979}>, <None, {eid: 85064051708}>",,,Springer,,,2020-03-24,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85083963946,True,False,True,False

In this context, DevOps has emerged as an evolution of the agile approaches.

However, in spite of its popularity, DevOps still lacks proper engineering frameworks to support continuous improvement. One of our key objectives is to contribute to the development of a DevOps engineering framework composed of process, methods, and tools. A core part of this framework relates to the modeling of the different aspects of the DevOps system. To better understand the requirements of modeling in a DevOps context, we focus on a Product Build use case provided by an industry partner.","DevOps, Modeling, Process",,,,,,,,"<Model-driven continuous deployment for quality devOps, {eid: 85054816400}>, <None, {eid: 85079097128}>, <Modeling DevOps deployment choices using process architecture design dimensions, {eid: 84952662031}>, <Models@run.Time: A guided tour of the state of the art and research challenges, {eid: 85059780955}>, <A systematic review of cloud modeling languages, {eid: 85042469266}>, <Model-Driven Software Engineering in Practice, Second Edition, {eid: 84878326137}>, <A feature-based survey of model view approaches, {eid: 85029537056}>, <None, {eid: 85079094629}>, <ENACT: Development, operation, and quality assurance of trustworthy smart IoT systems, {eid: 85061085691}>, <Stepwise adoption of continuous delivery in model-driven engineering, {eid: 85061101819}>, <Combining the continuous integration practice and the model-driven engineering approach, {eid: 84981165314}>, <None, {eid: 85079086512}>, <None, {eid: 85079097632}>, <None, {eid: 85079090788}>, <None, {eid: 85079098417}>, <The DevOps Handbook: How to Create World-Class Agility, Reliability, and Security in Technology Organizations, {eid: 85056895078}>, <None, {eid: 85079103807}>, <None, {eid: 85079098833}>, <None, {eid: 85079095973}>, <None, {eid: 85079087892}>, <Industry application of continuous integration modeling: A multiple-case study, {eid: 85006317122}>, <None, {eid: 85079098316}>, <The role of models and megamodels at runtime, {eid: 79957665127}>, <Streamlining devops automation for cloud applications using TOSCA as standardized metamodel, {eid: 84958740530}>",,,Springer,,,2019-05-06,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85079101956,False,True,False,False

In this context, a modelling challenge is to leverage the existing requirement engineering approaches to support measurements. Unfortunately, measurement methods are slow and costly by definition, preventing precisely measured requirements from being used in the DevOps loop. As a result, developers have to deal with grossly estimated elements, e.g., using story points promoted by agile methods. Thus, it is not possible to provide better support for the development team. We envision taking advantage of the artifacts that already exist in a DevOps context to provide better support for requirements measurement, making it available in an automated context such as the DevOps one. This paper focuses on the automated analysis of acceptance tests (e.g., expressed using the Gherkin language) to support functional measurement automation in a DevOps context. This proposition is illustrated by a scenario coming from an industrial partner, supporting the identification of four research challenges to be tackled.","acceptance tests, measurements, modelling",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85018529770}>, <None, {eid: 34247492520}>, <Requirements engineering quality revealed through functional size measurement: An empirical study in an agile context, {eid: 84929614339}>, <Reconciling requirements and continuous integration in an agile context, {eid: 85056905155}>, <Agile requirements engineering: From user stories to software architectures, {eid: 85123214884}>, <Detecting terminological ambiguity in user stories: Tool and experimentation, {eid: 85059318780}>, <Requirements engineering in the devops era, {eid: 85123206977}>, <Extended planning poker: A proposed model, {eid: 85097284427}>, <Effort estimation in agile software development: A systematic literature review, {eid: 84905666395}>, <Effort estimation with story points and cosmic function points-An industry case study, {eid: 85038356065}>, <The value of software sizing, {eid: 80051669402}>, <Measurement of functional size in conceptual models: A survey of measurement procedures based on cosmic, {eid: 58049096994}>, <Survey on methods for automated measurement of the software scale, {eid: 85081254723}>, <Cosmic functional size automation of Java web applications using the spring mvc framework, {eid: 85124044239}>, <Towards universal cosmic size measurement automation, {eid: 85098164029}>, <None, {eid: 84856142970}>, <Validating a size measure for effort estimation in model-driven web development, {eid: 77958152177}>, <Deep learning model for end-To-end approximation of cosmic functional size based on usecase names, {eid: 85082556990}>, <A comparison study of software testing activities in agile methods, {eid: 85123978606}>, <Automated acceptance tests as software requirements: An experiment to compare the applicability of fit tables and gherkin language, {eid: 85048046567}>, <A study of the characteristics of behaviour driven development, {eid: 82955178171}>, <Impacts of data uniformity in the reuse of acceptance test glue code, {eid: 85071378445}>, <Specmate: Automated creation of test cases from acceptance criteria, {eid: 85091594998}>, <None, {eid: 85123987728}>, <None, {eid: 85124000924}>, <Using scrum together with uml models: A collaborative university-industry r&d software project, {eid: 84978224440}>, <A commutative model composition operator to support software adaptation, {eid: 84864072985}>, <None, {eid: 85087589980}>, <Pycg: Practical call graph generation in python, {eid: 85115710035}>, <Clever: Combining code metrics with clone detection for just-in-Time fault prevention and resolution in large industrial projects, {eid: 85051650020}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2021-10-10,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85124032258,False,True,False,False

These models are often heterogeneous in terms of modeling language, provenance, number or scale. They can be notably managed by different persistence frameworks adapted to their nature. As a result, the information relevant to engineers is usually split into several interrelated models. To be useful in practice, these models need to be integrated together to provide global views over the system under study. Model view approaches have been proposed to tackle such an issue. They provide an unification mechanism to combine and query heterogeneous models in a transparent way. These views usually target specific engineering tasks such as system design, monitoring, evolution, etc. In our present context, the MegaM@Rt2 industrially-supported European initiative defines a set of large-scale use cases where model views can be beneficial for tracing runtime and design time data. However, existing model view solutions mostly rely on in-memory constructs and low-level modeling APIs that have not been designed to scale in the context of large models stored in different kinds of sources. This paper presents the current status of our work towards a general solution to efficiently support scalable model views on heterogeneous model resources. It describes our integration approach between model view and model persistence frameworks. This notably implies the refinement of the view framework for the construction of large views from multiple model storage solutions. This also requires to study how parts of queries can be computed on the contributing models rather than on the view. Our solution has been benchmarked on a practical large-scale use case from the MegaM@Rt2 project, implementing a runtime - design time feedback loop. The corresponding EMF-based tooling support and modeling resources are fully available online.","Database, Design Time, Modeling, Persistence, Runtime, Scalability, Views",,,,,,,,"<The Megam@rt2 ECSEL project: Megamodelling at runtime - Scalable model-based framework for continuous development and runtime validation of complex systems, {eid: 85048178927}>, <Hawk: Towards a scalable model indexing architecture, {eid: 84904444713}>, <Incremental Evaluation of Model Queries over EMF models, {eid: 78349303110}>, <A Feature-based Survey of Model View Approaches, {eid: 85066350223}>, <Modisco: A model driven reverse engineering framework, {eid: 84900002114}>, <EMF views: A view mechanism for integrating heterogeneous models, {eid: 84951747182}>, <View-based Model-driven Software Development with ModelJoin, {eid: 84901557393}>, <How can we implement a Multidimensional Data Warehouse using NoSQL?, {eid: 84958972862}>, <Gremlin-ATL: A scalable model transformation framework, {eid: 85041446404}>, <NeoEMF: A Multi-database Model Persistence Framework for Very Large Models, {eid: 85028586965}>, <Mogwaï: A framework to handle complex queries on large models, {eid: 84987607022}>, <Query-driven incremental synchronization of view models, {eid: 84907072374}>, <Modeling cyber-physical systems, {eid: 84155172767}>, <None, {eid: 85056861122}>, <An eclipse modelling framework alternative to meet the models@runtime requirements, {eid: 84867650983}>, <Addressing Modularity for Heterogeneous Multi-model Systems using Model Federation, {eid: 84965060048}>, <Selection of views to materialize in a data warehouse, {eid: 84948964173}>, <Model-driven engineering practices in industry: Social, organizational and managerial factors that lead to success or failure, {eid: 84900499307}>, <ATL: A model transformation tool, {eid: 45849085734}>, <CloudMDSQL: Querying heterogeneous cloud data stores with a common language, {eid: 84944603835}>, <Eclipse development tools for epsilon, {eid: 36049004338}>, <Merging models with the epsilon merging language (EML), {eid: 33750362774}>, <A research roadmap towards achieving scalability in model driven engineering, {eid: 84880430801}>, <Constructing and navigating noninvasive model decorations, {eid: 77954752082}>, <None, {eid: 85056869322}>, <None, {eid: 85056824922}>, <None, {eid: 85049685176}>, <None, {eid: 74549142762}>, <None, {eid: 85048809213}>, <EMF-incquery: An integrated development environment for live model queries, {eid: 84916891711}>, <Road to a reactive and incremental model transformation platform: Three generations of the Viatra framework, {eid: 84966700829}>, <An efficient computation strategy for allinstances(), {eid: 84938600227}>, <The state of practice in model-driven engineering, {eid: 84899687758}>, <Deterministic lazy mutable OCL collections, {eid: 85042681746}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2018-10-14,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85056878573,True,True,False,False

These emergent system behaviors occur when system engineers develop their system under the closed-world assumption, but this assumption is not met during its operation. This means that system engineers work on the basis that they have complete knowledge of the system and its environment during its design, when the system specification that has been created is actually incomplete. In this paper, an observation of an emergent behavior is considered to be a solid proof that the system model specification is still incomplete. A conceptual framework is proposed to harness the emergent behavior and complete the system specification that is provided during the its design. The framework consists of two parts, system development and system operations. It is built on a model-driven approach in order to provide a clear definition of the emergent behavior and a concrete development scheme. The framework exploits the DevOps paradigm as a successful paradigm to achieve the ultimate goal of developing complete system models through the continuous specification completion based on the observed emergent behavior. The goal of this framework is to help develop high-quality and reliable emergent systems based on the specification derived from the emergent behavior that occurred at run time.","Complex systems, DevOps, For-mal methods, Software development process, Software evolution",,,,,,,,"<Model-driven software engineering in practice, {eid: 84878326137}>, <Introduction to model checking, {eid: 85054044441}>, <The agile manifesto, {eid: 2342509886}>, <10+ deploys per day: Dev and ops cooperation at flickr, {eid: 84889710019}>, <A survey of devops concepts and challenges, {eid: 85075608026}>, <How to extend the abstraction refinement model for systems with emergent behavior, {eid: 85171980959}>, <Towards a model-based devops for cyberphysical systems, {eid: 85096956543}>, <None, {eid: 85169581544}>, <None, {eid: 85148103544}>, <Explorations in cyber-physical systems education, {eid: 85129213195}>, <Abstraction refinement: A model of software evolution, {eid: 84987195843}>, <Specminer: Heuristicbased mining of service behavioral models from interaction traces, {eid: 85097190698}>, <General ltl specification mining (t), {eid: 84963856546}>, <Mining program workflow from interleaved logs, {eid: 85172026613}>, <On the synthesis of finite-state machines from samples of their behavior, {eid: 84938806379}>, <Deep specification mining, {eid: 85051560408}>, <Dynamic specification mining based on transformer, {eid: 85135016391}>, <General past-time linear temporal logic specification mining, {eid: 85131808183}>, <Automated generation of requirements-based test cases for an adaptive cruise control system, {eid: 85051046296}>, <Nusmv: a new symbolic model checker, {eid: 84896869660}>, <Mesa: an agent-based modeling framework, {eid: 85033460993}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2022-12-14,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85171982715,True,True,False,True

Indeed, the increasing size of models leads to difficulties in interacting with them efficiently. To tackle this scalability issue, some tools are built upon specific computational strategies exploiting reactivity, or parallelism. However, their performances may vary depending on the specific nature of their usage. Choosing the most suitable computational strategy for a given usage is a difficult task which should be automated. Besides, the most efficient solutions may be obtained by the use of several strategies at the same time. This paper motivates the need for a transparent multi-strategy execution mode for model-management operations. We present an overview of the different computational strategies used in the model-driven engineering ecosystem, and use a running example to introduce the benefits of mixing strategies for performing a single computation. This example helps us present our design ideas for a multi-strategy model-management system. The code-related and DevOps challenges that emerged from this analysis are also presented.","Low-code development, Model-driven engineering, Multi-strategy, OCL, Spark",,,,,,,,"<Sampling eect on performance prediction of congurable systems: A case study, {eid: 85085937290}>, <Validity of the single processor approach to achieving large scale computing capabilities, {eid: 77955527355}>, <Towards a formal specification of multi-paradigm modelling, {eid: 85075937334}>, <Atlmr: Model transformation on mapreduce, {eid: 84964711811}>, <Distributing relational model transformation on MapReduce, {eid: 85045642775}>, <Incremental pasern matching in the viatra model transformation system, {eid: 57449114393}>, <Cache oblivious distribution sweeping, {eid: 84869191441}>, <A linda-based platform for the parallel execution of out-place model transformations, {eid: 84977275159}>, <Towards distributed model transformations with lintra, {eid: 85071652388}>, <Parallel in-place model transformations with lintra, {eid: 84938634095}>, <None, {eid: 0004101993}>, <Incremental integrity checking of UML/ OCL conceptual schemas, {eid: 68949105369}>, <Linda in context, {eid: 0024640163}>, <Madeus: A formal deployment model, {eid: 85057400219}>, <One trillion edges: Graph processing at facebook-scale, {eid: 84953851582}>, <None, {eid: 0003587629}>, <Extensibility and composability of a multi-stencil domain specific framework, {eid: 85034622453}>, <Integrated model-checking for the design of safe and e?cient distributed soware commissioning, {eid: 85076956600}>, <O.Ee SIPSim implicit parallelism model and the SkelGIS library, {eid: 84928668168}>, <MapReduce: Simplified data processing on large clusters, {eid: 85030321143}>, <None, {eid: 85096789319}>, <Graphx: Graph processing in a distributed dataflow framework, {eid: 85072954017}>, <None, {eid: 0000835369}>, <Parallel graph transformations on multicore systems, {eid: 84862193779}>, <A component concept for typed graphs with inheritance and containment structures, {eid: 78649902907}>, <Implementing graph transformations in the bulksynchronousparallel model, {eid: 84900559020}>, <Cost model for pregel on graphx, {eid: 85030158943}>, <Aroma: Automated resource allocation and configuration of mapreduce environment in the cloud, {eid: 84867709937}>, <Effi-cient atl incremental transformations, {eid: 85070475719}>, <Towards optimisation of model eries: A parallel execution approach, {eid: 85083157374}>, <Pregel: A system for largescale graph processing, {eid: 77954723629}>, <Machine learning and congurable systems: A gentle introduction, {eid: 85123042973}>, <Reactive model transformation with ATL, {eid: 84994520014}>, <Towards truly parallel model transformations : AA distributed paSern matching approach, {eid: 70449623228}>, <Pyske: Algorithmic skeletons for python, {eid: 85082121316}>, <None, {eid: 85096794650}>, <Coqtl: An internal DSL for model transformation in coq, {eid: 85048825703}>, <Lazy evaluation for ocl, {eid: 84960968946}>, <Lowcomote: Training the next generation of experts in scalable low-code engineering platforms, {eid: 85069741151}>, <Parallel execution of atl transformation rules, {eid: 84886819456}>, <Lazy execution of model-to-model transformations, {eid: 80054075977}>, <Towards systematic parallelization of graph transformations over pregel, {eid: 84961634182}>, <Runtime model validation with parallel object constraint language, {eid: 84856810808}>, <A bridging model for parallel computation, {eid: 0025467711}>, <A rete network construction algorithm for incremental pasern matching, {eid: 84884323292}>, <Deterministic lazy mutable ocl collections, {eid: 85042681746}>",,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,,2020-10-16,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85096808259,True,True,False,True

We advocate that the application of Model-Driven Engineering principles as meta-modeling and model transformation can cope with this problem, improving the interoperability of artifacts in the test case generation process, thus bringing benefits in case of agile development processes, where system and technology evolution is frequent. In this paper, we present our contribution to this idea, introducing i) a reference metamodel, which stores the business process behavior and the information to generate input models for testing tools, and ii) transformations from orchestration languages towards testing tools. The proposed approach is implemented in a testing framework and evaluated on a case study where multiple orchestrations are expressed in two languages. Also, the paper presents how test cases are appropriately generated and successfully executed, starting from an orchestration model as a consequence of successful transformations.","Meta-modeling, Model-Based Testing, Model-Driven Engineering, SOA",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85099885107}>, <Integration of distributed enterprise applications: A survey, {eid: 84898426599}>, <Microservices approach for the internet of things, {eid: 84996593372}>, <Making system of systems interoperable-The core components of the arrowhead framework, {eid: 84994852297}>, <Web services orchestration and choreography, {eid: 0142039821}>, <Testing and verification in service-oriented architecture: A survey, {eid: 84877618825}>, <Devops enhancement with continuous test optimization, {eid: 85056906246}>, <Evaluating the efficiency of continuous testing during test-driven development, {eid: 85051030523}>, <World quality report 2019-20, {eid: 85099886365}>, <A holistic approach to model-based testing of Web service compositions, {eid: 84891832091}>, <None, {eid: 85099885041}>, <The samba approach for self-Adaptive model-based online testing of services orchestrations, {eid: 85072691171}>, <Guest editor?s introduction: Model-driven engineering, {eid: 33344465743}>, <Model-driven engineering: A survey supported by the unified conceptual model, {eid: 84938742646}>, <A taxonomy of model-based testing approaches, {eid: 84862325128}>, <The vision of autonomic computing, {eid: 0037253062}>, <None, {eid: 41649087956}>, <None, {eid: 85020724579}>, <None, {eid: 85082763956}>, <None, {eid: 85099877081}>, <None, {eid: 84942524388}>, <None, {eid: 85099877717}>, <None, {eid: 85099882557}>, <Classification of model transformation approaches, {eid: 17744391650}>, <None, {eid: 84921469336}>, <The oracle problem in software testing: A survey, {eid: 84929331583}>, <None, {eid: 41649087956}>, <ATL-eclipse support for model transformation, {eid: 85099878178}>, <None, {eid: 85099885759}>, <None, {eid: 79958013259}>, <None, {eid: 85082763956}>, <A survey on modelbased testing tools for test case generation, {eid: 85099875604}>, <Model-based testing in practice, {eid: 0032660359}>, <Momut:: UML model-based mutation testing for UML, {eid: 84935063995}>, <Automatic generation of test cases from UML models, {eid: 85075930566}>, <The MIDAS cloud platform for testing SOA applications, {eid: 84935107263}>, <A meta-model to support regression testing of web applications, {eid: 70449727279}>, <A formal framework for service orchestration testing based on symbolic transition systems, {eid: 70549108087}>, <Introducing modeldriven testing in scrum process using U2TP and AndroMDA, {eid: 85073151444}>, <Improving evidence about software technologies: A look at model-based testing, {eid: 44149126224}>, <Basic concepts on systems of systems, {eid: 85006741799}>, <A simulation-based architecture for smart cyberphysical systems, {eid: 84991687905}>",,,IEEE Computer Society,,,2020-12-01,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85099878724,True,True,False,False

VeriDevOps, Horizon 2020 project, aims at providing a faster feedback loop for verifying the security requirements and other quality attributes of large scale cyber-physical systems. VeriDevOps focuses on optimizing the security verification activities, by automatically creating verifiable models directly from security requirements formulated in natural language, using these models to check security properties on design models and then generating artefacts such as, tests or monitors that can be used later in the DevOps process. The main drivers for these advances are: Natural Language Processing, a combined formal verification and model-based testing approach, and machine-learning-based security monitors. VeriDevOps is in its initial stage - the project started on 1.10.2020 and it will run for three years.

As an aid to designers and developers, we developed OSTIA (Ordinary Static Topology Inference Analysis) that allows detecting the occurrence of common anti-patterns across big data architectures and exploiting software verification techniques on the elicited architectural models. This paper illustrates OSTIA and evaluates its uses and benefits on three industrial-scale case-studies.","Big data architectures, Big data systems verification, Software design and analysis",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85066032062}>, <None, {eid: 85066020659}>, <None, {eid: 85066053629}>, <None, {eid: 85066016858}>, <None, {eid: 85066030200}>, <None, {eid: 85066025117}>, <None, {eid: 85066019426}>, <None, {eid: 85066034835}>, <None, {eid: 85066012095}>, <None, {eid: 85066023134}>, <A Timed Semantics of Workflows, {eid: 84951132701}>, <Continuous architecting of stream-based systems, {eid: 84983339996}>, <A tool for deciding the satisfiability of continuous-time metric temporal logic, {eid: 84959559133, doi: 10.1007/s00236-015-0229-y}>, <None, {eid: 84968786582}>, <Formal verification problems in a big data world: Towards a mighty synergy, {eid: 84903647900}>, <Stormgen - a domain specific language to create ad-hoc storm topologies, {eid: 84941570893}>, <None, {eid: 0003866308}>, <An automata-theoretic approach to constraint LTL, {eid: 84855195612, doi: 10.1016/j.ic.2006.09.006}>, <A software architecture framework for quality-aware devops, {eid: 85054050217}>, <Understandable big data: a survey, {eid: 84940452273, doi: 10.1016/j.cosrev.2015.05.002}>, <Apache storm, a hands on tutorial, {eid: 85015882046}>, <None, {eid: 0141684320}>, <Modeling time in computing: a taxonomy and a comparative survey, {eid: 77949400735, doi: 10.1145/1667062.1667063}>, <Ibm streams processing language: analyzing big data in motion, {eid: 84893537534, doi: 10.1147/JRD.2013.2243535}>, <A bibliometric approach to tracking big data research trends, {eid: 85030459021, doi: 10.1186/s40537-017-0088-1}>, <None, {eid: 0004040339}>, <Towards the formal verification of DIA through MTL models, {eid: 85066015826}>, <None, {eid: 0003594156, doi: 10.4135/9781412984287}>, <Visualizing big data with augmented and virtual reality: challenges and research agenda, {eid: 85013964229, doi: 10.1186/s40537-015-0031-2}>, <Cost-based optimization of logical partitions for a query workload in a hadoop data warehouse, {eid: 84958545302}>, <The temporal logic of programs, {eid: 85047040703}>, <Bounded satisfiability checking of metric temporal logic specifications, {eid: 84894515204, doi: 10.1145/2491509.2491514}>, <Beyond the lambda architecture: Effective scheduling for large scale eo information mining and interactive thematic mapping, {eid: 84962530511}>, <A theory of timed automata, {eid: 0028413052, doi: 10.1016/0304-3975(94)90010-8}>, <None, {eid: 84877800451}>, <Geometrical and topological approaches to big data, {eid: 84979556390, doi: 10.1016/j.future.2016.06.005}>, <Reliability analysis based on a jump diffusion model with two wiener processes for cloud computing with big data, {eid: 84940549083, doi: 10.3390/e17074533}>, <None, {eid: 84925263722}>, <Storm@ twitter, {eid: 84904335699}>, <Optimizing big data processing performance in the public cloud: opportunities and approaches, {eid: 84944054192, doi: 10.1109/MNET.2015.7293302}>, <Formalizing mapreduce with csp, {eid: 77953209591}>",,,SpringerOpen,,,2019-12-01,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,2-s2.0-85066050998,False,False,True,False

Until now, it is the responsibility of data scientists to create ad-hoc ML pipelines for each situation they encounter, gaining knowledge about the adequacy between their context and the chosen pipeline. Considering that it is not possible at a human scale to analyze the exponential number of potential pipelines, picking the right pipeline that combines the proper preprocessing and algorithms is a hard task that requires knowledge and experience. In front of the complexity of building a right ML pipeline, algorithm portfolios aim to drive algorithm selection, learning from the past in a continuous process. However, building a portfolio requires that (i) data scientists develop and test pipelines and (ii) portfolio maintainers ensure the quality of the portfolio and enrich it. The firsts are the developers, while the seconds are the operators. In this paper, we present a set of criteria to be respected, and propose a pipeline-based meta-model, to support a DevOps approach in the context of Machine Learning Pipelines. The exploitation of this meta-model, both as a graph and as a logical expression, serves to ensure continuity between Dev and Ops. We depict our proposition through the simplified study of two primary use cases, one with developer's point-of-view, the other with ops'.","DevOps, MachineLearning, Meta-Learning, Pipeline",,,,,,,,"<On the predictive power of meta-features in OpenML, {eid: 85041037223}>, <ASlib: {A} benchmark library for algorithm selection, {eid: 84962888054}>, <Metamodel-based test generation for model transformations: An algorithm and A tool, {eid: 34547699175}>, <Towards A software product line for machine learning workflows: Focus on supporting evolution, {eid: 84996964947}>, <Do we need hundreds of classifiers to solve real world classification problems?, {eid: 84919773193}>, <The path to devops, {eid: 85049785632}>, <Improving confidence in experimental systems through automated construction of argumentation diagrams, {eid: 85022326190}>, <Algorithm portfolios, {eid: 0035250831}>, <Reinforcement learning for automatic online algorithm selection-an empirical study, {eid: 85046262481}>, <None, {eid: 85075956242}>, <Algorithm Selection for Combinatorial Search Problems: {A} Survey, {eid: 85004008362}>, <Towards automatic composition of multicomponent predictive systems, {eid: 84964091554}>, <Adore A logical meta-model supporting business process evolution, {eid: 84878248026}>, <Machine Learning and Deep Learning frameworks and libraries for large-scale data mining: A survey, {eid: 85060332849}>, <The algorithm selection problem, {eid: 0003056605}>, <A survey of intelligent assistants for data analysis, {eid: 84880124349}>, <Sharing RapidMiner workflows and experiments with OpenML, {eid: 84944264553}>, <OpenML: Networked science in machine learning, {eid: 84944261791}>, <No free lunch theorems for optimization, {eid: 0031118203}>",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,,2019-09-15,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85075935517,False,True,True,False

New software engineering challenges for BDA applications include ensuring performance levels of data-driven algorithms even in the presence of large data volume, velocity, and variety (3Vs). BDA software complexity frequently leads to delayed deployments, longer development cycles, and challenging performance assessment. This paper proposes a Domain-Specific Model (DSM), and DevOps practices to design, deploy, and monitor performance metrics in BDA applications. Our proposal includes a design process, and a framework to define architectural inputs, software components, and deployment strategies through integrated high-level abstractions to enable QS monitoring. We evaluate our approach with four use cases from different domains to demonstrate a high level of generalization. Our results show a shorter deployment and monitoring times, and a higher gain factor per iteration compared to similar approaches.","Big data analytics deployment, DevOps, Domain-specific model, Performance monitoring, Quality scenarios, Software architecture",,,,,,,,"<Quality-Aware Processing Pipeline Modeling: Tech.

The heterogeneity of these solutions hinders the proper exploitation of cloud computing since it prevents interoperability and promotes vendor lock-in, which increases the complexity of executing and managing multi-cloud applications (i.e., Applications that can be deployed across multiple cloud infrastructures and platforms). Providers of multi-cloud applications seek to exploit the peculiarities of each cloud solution and to combine the delivery models of IaaS and PaaS in order to optimise performance, availability, and cost.

Many software organizations are heading towards DevOps to leverage its benefits in terms of improved development speed, stability, collaboration, and communication. DevOps practices are essential to effectively implement in software organizations, but little attention has been given in the literature to how these practices can be managed. Our study aims to propose and develop a framework for effectively managing DevOps practices. We have conducted an empirical study using the publicly available HELENA2 dataset to identify the best practices for effectively implementing DevOps. Furthermore, we have used the prediction algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forest (RF) to develop a prediction model for DevOps implementation. The findings of this study show that “Continuous deployment”, “Coding standards”, “Continuous integration”, and “Daily Standup” ""are the most significant practicesduring the life cycle of projects for effectively managing the DevOps practices. The contribution of this study is not only limited to investigating the best DevOps practices but also provides a prediction of DevOps project success and prioritization of best practices. It can assist software organizations in getting the best possible practices to focus on based on the nature of their projects.","Artificial neural network, DevOps, Prediction model, Random forest,

Still, current practices and available integration platforms are too code-oriented. They are not well adapted to work with other, non text-based, software artifacts typically produced during early phases of the software engineering life-cycle. This is especially problematic for teams adopting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach to software development where several (meta)models (and model transformations) are built and executed as part of the development process. Typically, (part of) the code is automatically generated from such models. Therefore, in a complete CD process, changes in a model should trigger changes on the generated code when appropriate. A step further would be to apply CD practices to the development of modeling artefacts themselves. Analogously to “traditional” CD, where the goal is to have the mainline codebase always in a deployable state, the aim would be to have the modeling infrastructure always ready to be used. Those models could be the final product themselves or an intermediate artifact in a complete CSE process as described above. Either way, a tighter integration between CD and MDE would benefit software practitioners by providing them with complete CSE, covering also analysis and design stages of the process.","Continuous delivery, Continuous evolution, Model-driven engineering",,,,,,,,"<None, {eid: 85061088999}>, <Agile software development, {eid: 84862080030}>, <Model-driven continuous deployment for quality DevOps, {eid: 85054816400}>, <None, {eid: 4243422367}>, <None, {eid: 84878326137}>, <None, {eid: 84977560005}>, <None, {eid: 77955162010}>, <Co-evolution of metamodels and models through consistent change propagation, {eid: 84925249904}>, <Automated co-evolution of GMF editor models, {eid: 79952273948}>, <Models@Runtime for continuous design and deployment, {eid: 85028707045}>, <Continuous software engineering: A roadmap and agenda, {eid: 84991441356}>, <Model transformation co-evolution: A semiautomatic approach, {eid: 84872726686}>, <Combining the continuous integration practice and the model-driven engineering approach, {eid: 84981165314}>, <MORSE: A model-aware service environment, {eid: 77949633453}>, <Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation, {eid: 84903601568}>, <EMFStore: A model repository for EMF models, {eid: 77954724460}>, <Merging models with the epsilon merging language (EML), {eid: 33750362774}>, <A framework for composing modular and interoperable model management tasks, {eid: 70350086431}>, <Evolving models in model-driven engineering: State-of-the-art and future challenges, {eid: 84949883493}>, <An infrastructure modelling tool for cloud provisioning, {eid: 85032348388}>, <Presentation of EMF compare utility, {eid: 47749101164}>, <The state of practice in model-driven engineering, {eid: 84899687758}>, <Industrial adoption of model-driven engineering: Are the tools really the problem?, {eid: 84886821083}>",,,Springer Verlag,,,2018-03-05,,,,,,,eng,,Book Series,,,,2-s2.0-85061101819,True,True,False,False

In particular, CPS require to support both the integration of physical and cyber parts in innovative complex systems or production chains, together with the management of the data gathered from the environment to drive dynamic reconfiguration at runtime or finding improved designs. In such a context, the engineering of CPS must rely on models to uniformly reason about various heterogeneous concerns all along the system life cycle. In the last decades, the use of models has been intensively investigated both at design time for driving the development of complex systems, and at runtime as a reasoning layer to support deployment, monitoring and runtime adaptations. However, the approaches remain mostly independent. With the advent of DevOps principles, the engineering of CPS would benefit from supporting a smooth continuum of models from design to runtime, and vice versa.

The design of such systems bears high risk due to uncertainty in requirements related to service function and behavior, operation environments, and evolving customer needs. Such risks and uncertainties are well known in the IT sector, where DevOps principles ensure continuous system improvement through reliable and frequent delivery processes. A modular and service-oriented system architecture complements these processes to facilitate IT system adaptation and evolution.Objective: This work proposes a method to use and extend the Digital Twins (DTs) of IPSS assets for enabling the continuous optimization of CPS service delivery and the latter's adaptation to changing needs and environments. This reduces uncertainty during design and operations by assuring IPSS integrity and availability, especially for design and service adaptations at CPS runtime.Methodology: The method builds on transferring IT DevOps principles to DT-enabled CPS IPSS. The chosen design approach integrates, reuses, and aligns the DT processing and communication resources with DevOps requirements derived from literature.Results: We use these requirements to propose a DT-enabled self-Adaptive CPS model, which guides the realization of DT-enabled DevOps in CPS IPSS. We further propose detailed design models for operation-critical DTs that integrate CPS closed-loop control and architecture-based CPS adaptation. This integrated approach enables the implementation of A/B testing as a use case and central concept to enable CPS IPSS service adaptation and reconfiguration.Conclusion: The self-Adaptive CPS model and DT design concept have been validated in an evaluation environment for operation-critical CPS IPSS. The demonstrator achieved sub-millisecond cycle times during service A/B testing at runtime without causing CPS operation interferences and downtime.","CPS, Deployment, DevOps, Digital Twin, IPSS,

Graphical modeling languages and code generation technologies are enabling agile model development workflows, so that simulation modelers can update their models more easily. However, the process from changing the model to releasing a new simulation version is overlooked. Simulation deployment can be defined as a collection of activities, including model checking, Model-in-the-Loop testing, code generation, build, Software-in-the-Loop testing, deployment, when applicable Processor-in-the-Loop and Hardware-in-the-Loop testing and release. When it is conducted manually and ad hoc, it is repetitive, labor intensive, time-consuming and error prone. The automation of deployment pipeline, on the other hand, requires extensive scripting, unfortunately, in way in which simulation modelers are usually not accustomed. Causal Block Diagrams propose a graphical modeling language that is extensively used in simulation of technical systems. MATLAB/Simulink supports them as the basic modeling language. Exploiting the competence of MATLAB/Simulink users on Causal Block Diagrams, this paper presents a model-based approach for automating the simulation deployment activities. Thus, rather than scripting, the deployment automation functions are made available and accessible to the simulation modelers within the graphical modeling environment that they are using.","Continuous delivery, Model-based simulation systems engineering, Simulation deployment",,,,,,,,None,,,The Society for Modeling and Simulation International,,,None,,,,,,,eng,,Conference Proceeding,,,,2-s2.0-85051093462,False,False,False,False

A key difference between the two lies in the strong dependency between the quality of a machine learning model and the quality of the data used to train or perform evaluations. In this work, we demonstrate how different aspects of data quality propagate through various stages of machine learning development. By performing a joint analysis of the impact of well-known data quality dimensions and the downstream machine learning process, we show that different components of a typical MLOps pipeline can be efficiently designed, providing both a technical and theoretical perspective.",None,,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,,False,False,True,True

It inaugurates the era of extreme ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (xURLLC) and pervades the digitalization of the various vertical immersive use cases. Since 6G inherently underpins artificial intelligence (AI), we propose a systematic and standalone slice termed SliceOps that is natively embedded in the 6G architecture, which gathers and manages the whole AI lifecycle through monitoring, re-training, and deploying the machine learning (ML) models as a service for the 6G slices. By leveraging machine learning operations (MLOps) in conjunction with eXplainable AI (XAI), SliceOps strives to cope with the opaqueness of black-box AI using explanation-guided reinforcement learning (XRL) to fulfill transparency, trustworthiness, and interpretability in the network slicing ecosystem. This article starts by elaborating on the architectural and algorithmic aspects of SliceOps. Then, the deployed cloud-native SliceOps working is exemplified via a latency-aware resource allocation problem. The deep RL (DRL)-based SliceOps agents within slices provide AI services aiming to allocate optimal radio resources and impede service quality degradation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of SliceOps-driven slicing. The article discusses afterward the SliceOps challenges and limitations. Finally, the key open research directions corresponding to the proposed approach are identified.","6G, AI, MLOps, network slicing, resource allocation, XAI, XRL, zero-touch",,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,,False,False,True,True

While this cradle-to-grave concept is well documented throughout literature, there has been recent emphasis on evolving and digitally transforming systems engineering methodologies, practices, and tools for the latter phases of system life cycles. This article adapts principles from the software engineering domain DevOps concept (a collaborative merger of system development and operations) into a Systems Engineering DevOps (SEDevOps) life cycle model. This facilitates a merger of systems engineering processes, tools, and products into a surrogate operational environment in which the sustainment of a system is tied closely to the curation of a system model expanded to include the enabling system elements necessary for operations and sustainment (procedures, scripts, etc.). This progression of the systems engineering mindset, focused on digitally transforming and enhancing system operations and sustainment, improves agility in later life cycle phases. A framework for applying SEDevOps is introduced as a new systems modeling language profile. A use-case leveraging this model-based system operations framework, shows how merging support elements into a spacecraft system model improves adaptability during operations, exemplifying elements of a DevOps approach to cyber-physical system sustainment.","Agile, DevOps, digital transformation, life cycle, model-based systems engineering (MBSE), systems engineering",,,,,,,,None,,,,,,None,,,,,,,eng,,Journal,,,,,True,True,False,True
