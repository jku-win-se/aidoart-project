This ontology provides a basic structure for representing the relationships between the concepts found in the n-grams list and focuses on the relationships between the provided n-grams and captures the relationships between concepts based on the frequency of their co-occurrence in the n-grams list.

Relationships:

Uses:
Software Development uses Software Architecture
Software Testing uses Test Case, Regression Testing
Machine Learning uses Big Data, Big Data Analytics
DevOps uses Cloud Computing

Related To:
Model-Driven Engineering related to Model-Based Development, Model-Based Testing
Continuous Integration related to Continuous Delivery
Artificial Intelligence related to Machine Learning
Test Case related to Regression Testing, Test Case Prioritization (assuming prioritization is for test cases)
DevOps related to Digital Twins, IoT
Testing related to Regression Testing, Integration Testing
Software Development related to Infrastructure Code, Quality Scenarios, Microservice Architecture, Modeling Languages
Software Quality related to Testing

Has A:
Systems Engineering has a Cyber-physical Systems

Notes:
The frequency of n-grams can be used to weight the strength of relationships between concepts.
This is a simplified ontology, and additional relationships and classes can be added based on domain knowledge.

"Systems and Software Development" encompasses a larger category due to the high number of n-grams related to it.
"Testing" is included as a class to group related concepts like Case Prioritization and Regression Testing.
"Machine Learning" is separated due to the presence of n-grams related to specific techniques (Deep Learning, Neural Networks).
Other relationships can be added based on further analysis (e.g., Cloud Computing and Infrastructure Code).
